                            concur, dating the manuscript to the end of that century. Guddat-Figge
                            erroneously dates it to the middle of the fifteenth century.</origDate>

                                <foliation>Foliation in both ink and pencil, both rather early. The
                                    foliation in ink numbers each leaf 1-5 and thereafter in
                                    intervals of 10 (i.e., 10, 20, 30, etc.). At a later date,
                                    numbers were added in pencil to the unfoliated leaves by a
                                    second hand. In quire X, the second hand corrects an error in
                                    counting by his predecessor, striking through “110” and
                                    replacing it with the correct “111.” Note also that the first
                                    hand returns to number the final leaves of Booklet I
                                    individually, but misnumbers 113, 114, 115, and 116 due the
                                    earlier error at fol. 110. The later foliator strikes through
                                    these and uses 115a and 115b to reach number 116 at the same
                                    point as his predecessor.</foliation>

                                    note, the codex contains two booklets, the first comprising ii +

                                <p>The text is in an anglicana script using brown ink throughout,
                                    and is likely the work of one scribe. Russell-Kane believe the
                                    entire manuscript to be the work of the same scribe, whereas
                                    Hanna-Lawton note that one scribe copied <title>Siege of
                                        Jerusalem</title> with "perhaps a second for the remainder."
                                    There are no running heads in <title>Siege of Jerusalem</title>,
                                    but <title>Piers Plowman</title> features running heads starting
                                    on fol. 69 and going through until the end, e.g., “Dowel,”
                                    “Dobet,” and “Dobest.” The first few of these (58v to 63r)
                                    appear to have been added later; the rest are contemporary with
                                    the text. Corrections are sparse, with subpunction on fol.
                                        <locus from="5r">5r</locus>, erasures on <locus from="9r"
                                        >9r</locus>, and a few supralinear additions by the main
                                    scribe (e.g., folios <locus from="3v">3v</locus>, <locus
                                        from="7v">7v</locus>, <locus from="9r">9r</locus>).</p>
                                <p>Lines generally begin with capital letter forms; initial letters
                                    that do not have a distinct lower case are likely intended as
                                    capitals. The caesura is marked throughout with a punctus
                                    elevatus. Note that the scribe frequently adds a backwards curl
                                    to final <hi rend="italic">–r</hi><graphic
                                        url="images/Lrcurl.jpg"/> to form the suspension <hi

                                <p>Kellogg's dissertation is an especially useful tool for the study
                                    of the dialect of Laud Misc. 656; whereas the dialect features
                                    of the other manuscripts are documented in appendices, the
                                    features of L are the focus of his dissertation and are
                                    discussed at great length. He concludes his work with a summary
                                    of the relationships of the dialects found in the manuscript,
                                    noting that L is the westernmost dialect of the group (Kellogg
                                    did not know of P or the Exeter fragment):</p>

                            <decoNote> There are few decorative features in the manuscript.
                                    <title>Siege of Jerusalem</title> has rubricated initials 3-5
                                lines in height at fols. <locus from="1v">1v</locus>, <locus

                                with paraphs or marginalia, but these multiline capitals correspond
                                to passus divisions recognized by Hanna-Lawton as authorial.
                                    <title>Piers</title> has spaces and guideletters for rubricated
                                initials, e.g., 19v, 25r, but these have not been realized; the same
                                is true in Booklet II, e.g., fol. 119v. </decoNote>

                                    otherwise original. Wooden boards, sloped at edges. Four raised
                                    bands as bound, rebacked spine utilizing original bands.
                                    Additionally, two slightly raised sewing structures, one at top
                                    and the other at bottom of spine, detectable. Flat spine.

                                    metal, present on front cover. The strap apparently hooked to a
                                    metal piece at center of back cover, where there is now a hole
                                    and corresponding discoloration in the leather. Single vellum
