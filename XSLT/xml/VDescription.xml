                                    <measure type="leavesCount" n="48">48 folios (bound with a group of 37 unrelated folios)</measure>

                                <foliation>The book comprises three codicologically unrelated groups of leaves, two of which are found in <locus from="1r" to="37r">fols. 1-37</locus> and the remainder in <locus from="38r" to="85r">fols. 38-85</locus>; only the latter are considered in this description. Foliation is continuous across these three units, however, commencing on the first parchment leaf and continuing throughout. <locus from="1r" to="5r">Fols. 1-5</locus> are foliated in a modern hand in pencil. Fol. 5 is followed by fol. 5*, which occurs on a blank leaf. An earlier foliation on what is now folios 2r-5r has been lined through. The counting of the blank leaf following fol. 5 as fol. 5* permits the modern pencil foliation (i.e., fols 1-5*) to join up with an earlier foliation in ink from 6r to the end. While the foliation runs consecutively, it appears to be in several hands. Pairs of blank parchment leaves following fols. <locus from="25r" to="25r">25</locus>, <locus from="37r" to="37r">37</locus>, and <locus from="69r" to="69r">69</locus> are not numbered; these were added by the binder. <locus from="62r" to="77r">Fols. 62-77</locus> were once numbered 70-85, while <locus from="78r" to="85r">fols. 78-85</locus> were once numbered 62-69, with the older numbers now crossed through, which suggests that the final two quires were previously bound in reverse order. The evidence of the quire signatures and the missing lines of <title>Siege of Jerusalem</title>, however, suggest that quire VI would not have come before quire V when the manuscript was first produced; apparently the quires were previously bound out of order, a mistake corrected in a later rebinding.</foliation>

                                    Each quire is sewn through the center to a stub in the modern binding. Quire marks suggest that there were formerly two quires between what are now the fourth and fifth quires. These must have contained the beginning of <title>Siege of Jerusalem</title>; at about 30 lines per leaf, there would be 480 lines per quire, thus 960 in the two quires, which, with the 362 extant lines, would amount to a full copy of the poem. Quires are numbered <hi rend="italic">x-xiii</hi> on leaves <locus from="38r" to="38r">38r</locus>, <locus from="46r" to="46r">46r</locus>, <locus from="54r" to="54r">54r</locus>, and <locus from="62r" to="62r">62r</locus>. <locus from="45v" to="45v">45v</locus> (i.e., the end of quire I) is labeled <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, with <locus from="46r" to="46r">46r</locus>, <locus from="54r" to="54r">54r</locus>, and <locus from="62r" to="62r">62r</locus> labeled <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Fol. <locus from="70r" to="70r">70r</locus> presents additional evidence regarding quire structures. At the bottom right is written either <hi rend="italic">xvj</hi> or possibly <hi rend="italic">x<expan>us</expan></hi>. The former fits with the facts that the previous extant gatherings are numbered <hi rend="italic">x-xiii</hi> and there are apparently two quires (containing the beginning of <title>Siege of Jerusalem</title>) missing (which would be <hi rend="italic">xiv</hi> and <hi rend="italic">xv</hi>). On the top right of 70r, beneath the foliation, is the numeral <hi rend="italic">3</hi>, which might signify that this is the thrid quire containing <title>Siege of Jerusalem</title>. A single catchword survives at <locus from="53v" to="53v">53v</locus>.

                        <handDesc>
                            <handNote>
                                <p>Previous scholars have disagreed on the number of scribes and the distribution of their work. <persName>Guddat-Figge</persName> lists four scribes, with the first copying <locus from="38r" to="69v">fols. 38r-69v</locus>, the second <locus from="70r" to="75v">fols. 70r-75v</locus>, the third <locus from="76r" to="82v">fols. 76r-82v</locus>, and the fourth <locus from="83r" to="85r">fols. 83r-85r</locus> (179). Hanna-Lawton agree that there were four scribes, but suggest that each section is by “a different hand and the two items of the second booklet different hands” (xvii). The manuscript was also consulted by the editors of LALME (LP 553), who state that there is only one hand throughout (422).</p> 
                                
                                <p>I argue conversely that there are two scribes. Scribe 1 copied <locus from="38r" to="69v">fols. 38-69</locus> using dark ink and an anglicana script mixed with secretary forms. Scribe 2 copied <locus from="70r" to="85r">fols. 70-85</locus> in brown ink and a secretary hand. A side-by-side analysis of English words occurring in <title>Siege of Jerusalem</title> as well as in item 5, the prose treatise on physiognomy, is useful for confirming that the same hand is responsible for both. For example, <hi rend="italic">And</hi> on <locus from="70r">70r</locus> and <locus from="83r" to="83r">83r</locus><graphic url="images/And.jpg"/>, <hi rend="italic">moche</hi> on <locus from="72v">72v</locus> and <locus from="83r" to="83r">83r</locus><graphic url="images/moche.jpg"/>, <hi rend="italic">þ[er]fore</hi> on <locus from="72r">72r</locus> and <locus from="83r" to="83r">83r</locus><graphic url="images/Therfore.jpg"/>, and <hi rend="italic">wołł</hi> on <locus from="75r">75r</locus> and <locus from="83r" to="83r">83r</locus>. While a word-to-word comparison cannot be made between <title>SJ</title> and the Latin texts in <locus from="76r" to="82v">fols. 76r-82v</locus>, a comparison of letterforms indicates that these texts are by the same scribe who copied the English texts that bookend them. For example, the roman numeral <hi rend="italic">xxx</hi> on <locus from="75r">75r</locus> and <locus from="82v" to="82v">82v</locus><graphic url="images/xxxti.jpg"/>, the distinctive capital <hi rend="italic">T</hi><graphic url="images/CapitalT.jpg"/> and capital <hi rend="italic">D</hi><graphic url="images/CapitalD.jpg"/> found throughout, as well as the distinctive flat-topped capital <hi rend="italic">N</hi><graphic url="images/CapitalN.jpg"/>.</p>
                                
                                <p>As Hanna-Lawton note, the fact that the scribe responsible for <title>The Three Kings of Cologne</title> is not the same as the scribe who copied <title>Siege of Jerusalem</title> means that we cannot apply the conclusions that the editors of LALME draw to <title>SJ</title>. While noting that the scribe of <title>Siege</title> does share agreement with LALME LP 553 in some instances, they also list a number of dialect features that point not to <placeName>Oakham, Rutland</placeName>, as LALME posits, but further east near <placeName>Lincoln</placeName>. They raise the possibility that “LALME’s LP 553 may show some interference from the <title>Three Kings</title> exemplar” (xvii). <persName>Kellogg</persName>'s analysis of the manuscript's language, which focused exclusively on the <title>SJ</title> portion of the text, also attributes the scribe to the <placeName>east Midlands</placeName>, although he does not offer a more specifc locality. He does, however, provide a list of thirty dialect features, some of which, such as the <hi rend="italic">-and</hi> present participle termination mentioned by Hanna-Lawton, make it clear that the dialect is distinct from that of <title>Three Kings of Cologne</title>. Hanna-Lawton also note the presence of the register of charters pertaining to <placeName>Lincoln</placeName> Cathedral in the front of the book; while this is not codicologically related to the portion containing <title>Three Kings</title> or <title>Siege</title>, it might be a further sign “pointing to such an <placeName>east Midland</placeName> provenance” (xvii).</p>
                                
                                <p>Scribe 2 uses a variety of typical suspensions and abbreviations. The text is not heavily corrected, although there are examples of overwriting, erasure, and deletion, all of which appear to be the work of the original scribe and are handled according to the policy discussed in the general introduction. In addition, he has a number of peculiar or problematic tendencies that are worth noting, some of which create problems of interpretation or consistency in transcriptional policy:</p>
                                
                                <p><hi rend="underline">Curl on <hi rend="italic">-r</hi></hi>: In nine instances, the scribe places a curl on final <hi rend="italic">-r</hi>. In most cases, it is apparent that this is intended to be expanded to <hi rend="italic">-re</hi>, as in <hi rend="italic">her[e]</hi>, l. 43<graphic url="images/V43rcurl.jpg"/>, which is elsewhere spelled <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">tresour[e]</hi>, l. 51, which is elsewhere spelled <hi rend="italic">tresoure</hi>. In three cases – <hi rend="italic">brothir</hi>, l. 29, and <hi rend="italic">copper</hi> and <hi rend="italic">silvir</hi>, both at l. 300 – the curl seems merely to be a flourish, as it does not curve back as far as the other six examples and the spelling does not require an expansion to <hi rend="italic">-re</hi>. Thus these three have been transcribed <hi rend="italic">-r'</hi>.</p>
                                
                                <p><hi rend="underline">Barred letters</hi>: Barred <hi rend="italic">-ll</hi>, which tends to be otiose throughout most of the <title>SJ</title> corpus, is used by this scribe to indicate suspended <hi rend="italic">-e</hi>, and has been expanded in the text accordingly. Note, e.g., barred <hi rend="italic">wałł</hi> 1x vs. <hi rend="italic">walle</hi> elsewhere, and <hi rend="italic">tille</hi> vs. barred <hi rend="italic">tiłł</hi>. The evidence for barred <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is mixed, and thus it has not been expanded. We find, for example, <hi rend="italic">higħ</hi> at l. 16 and l. 52  vs. <hi rend="italic">highe</hi> at l 226, but also barred <hi rend="italic">h</hi> in non-terminal positions within words where an expansion is clearly not indicated, as with l. 11, <hi rend="italic">wrougħt</hi>.</p>
                                
                                <p><hi rend="underline">Otiose tildes</hi>: The scribe frequently uses an otiose tilde, as at <hi rend="italic">worship</hi>, l. 19<graphic url="images/V19tilde.jpg"/>, <hi rend="italic">come</hi>, l. 75, and <hi rend="italic">wrought</hi>, l. 154. He is especially prone to place this mark above the letter <hi rend="italic">p</hi>, as he does with <hi rend="italic">worship</hi> at l. 19, <hi rend="italic">vp</hi>, l. 30, and <hi rend="italic">hap</hi>, l. 42.</p>
                                
                                <p><hi rend="underline">Otiose punctuation</hi>: The scribe consistently marks the medial pause with a punctus. He also has a tendency to place otiose punctūs throughout the text in other places where they have no apparent meaning as punctuation. These are often, but not always, less pronounced than those that he uses in the medial position; a number of examples may be seen clustered together in the first five lines of <locus from="71v">fol. 71v</locus>. Only medial punctūs and those appearing at the ends of lines have been transcribed.</p>

Blue multiline capitals, boxed and decorated with red leaves and vines, appear at lines 60 and 148. The former corresponds to a large, if not multiline, capital in C, as discussed in the description of that manuscript; the latter corresponds to the passus division on <locus from="72r">72r</locus>.</p>

Item 3 is adorned with a single 4-line blue lombard with red flourishing. No decoration in items 4 and 5.</p>

The bottom compartment, which is larger than the others, features an additional pair of gold-tooled lines near the bottom of the spine so that it is split into two sections, one similar in size to the other compartments, and the other an additional area about <measure type="written">10 mm</measure> in height defined by the extra tooled lines. Compartments 1, 5, and 6 decorated with gold tools. Compartments 3, 4, and 5 have text in gold on black leather background:</p>

                                <p>Front and back covers have gold stamp of <persName>Cotton</persName>'s coat of arms in center.</p>
                                
                                <p>A white oval sticker at the top of the spine reads <hi rend="italic">684</hi>; another at the bottom of the spine reads <hi rend="italic">b</hi>. Stamped in black ink, with a black ink frame, on rear pastedown: <hi rend="italic">B.L. 1978</hi>.  On front pastedown is written <hi rend="italic">684 B</hi>. A slip of paper affixed to the verso of the second paper flyleaf in the rear notes that the manuscript was "examined after Binding" in <date when="1978">1978</date>. In the front, a modern paper pastedown and four modern paper flyleaves. This is followed by a single earlier paper flyleaf from a previous binding, and this by a parchment leaf (<locus from="1r" to="1r">fol. 1</locus> in the present foliation) that may also have been a flyleaf in a previous binding. In the rear, a single paper flyleaf on early paper matching that in the front, followed by three modern paper flyleaves and a modern paper pastedown. A modern parchment bifolium is found following fols. <locus from="25r" to="25r">25</locus>, <locus from="37r" to="37r">37</locus>, and <locus from="69r" to="69r">69</locus>. The outer edges of leaves towards the end of the volume appear singed, which likely happened during the fire at the Ashburnham House in <date when="1731">1731</date>. </p>

                            <p>Nothing is known of the manuscript's early history. An <hi rend="italic">ex libris</hi> in the group of leaves comprising <locus from="2r" to="11r">fols. 2-11</locus>, material unrelated to the manuscript containing <title>Siege of Jerusalem</title>, reads <hi rend="italic">liber cartarum eccleise beate Marie Lincoliensis</hi>. As discussed above, it is impossible to know whether this has bearing on the origins of the portion of the book containing <title>SJ</title>. As a group, the famous <persName>Cotton</persName> manuscripts were owned by <persName>Sir Robert Bruce Cotton</persName> (<date from="1571" to="1631">1571-1631</date>) and presented as a gift to the nation of Great Britain by his grandson, <persName>Sir John Cotton</persName>, in <date when="1700">1700</date>. They were initially housed in Ashburnham House, <placeName>Westminster</placeName>, where a fire destroyed or damaged about twenty-five percent of them in <date when="1731">1731</date>. The manuscripts are now part of The British Library.</p>
