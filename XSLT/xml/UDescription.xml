On the lower right margin there is a foliation in units of ten that would be preferable if complete, as it does not count flyleaves and thus is more accurate – i.e., 21 should actually be 20, 41 should actually be 40, etc. This hand also numbers the first folio of the second and third texts as 139 and 186 respectively, which is correct. All references to the manuscript in this description and in this archive more broadly use the folio numbers found at the top right, however.</foliation>

                                <p>One scribe throughout, using brown ink and an anglicana formata script, who has been identified as <persName>Richard Frampton</persName>, a professional scribe based in <placeName>London</placeName>. <persName>Guddat-Figge</persName> believed the manuscript to be the work of three scribes, an opinion that has not held up in subsequent analyses by Hanna-Lawton, <persName>Doyle</persName>, and <persName>Somerville</persName>, who believe it all to be the work of <persName>Frampton</persName>. <persName>Doyle</persName> and <persName>Parks</persName> (and, after them, Hanna-Lawton) list other manuscripts known to be by <persName>Frampton</persName>, which include "two enormous Coucher books" for the Duchy of Lancaster (now PRO D.L. 42, 1 and 2), a two-volume breviary for <persName>Henry IV</persName>, and Glasgow University Library, Hunterian MS T.4.1, which begins with the same two Latin histories as U. Hanna-Lawton add that <persName>Frampton</persName> is also responsible for portions of Huntington Library, MS HM 19920 and British Library, MS Cotton Claudius D.ii. For more on <persName>Frampton</persName>, see also <persName>Doyle</persName> and <persName>Parkes</persName>, "The Production of Copies of the <title>Canterbury Tales</title> and the <title>Confessio Amantis</title> in the Early Fifteenth Century" (especially p. 192 and note 65) and <persName>Somerville</persName>, "The Cowcher Books of the Duchy of Lancaster.”</p> 
                                
                                <p>The scribe uses a variety of typical suspensions and abbreviations. Lines generally begin with capital letter forms; initial letters that do not have a distinct lower case are likely intended as capitals, have been transcribed as they appear. The caesura is marked throughout with a slash and has been transcribed "/." There is a header reading <hi rend="italic">Incipit destruccio de Ier[usa]lem per Titum &amp; Vespasianu[m]</hi>, but no running heads.</p>
                                
                                <p>The capital form of <hi rend="italic">S</hi> differs from the lower case only in size. Because these letters occur in a spectrum of sizes and not always in a manner that makes it clear beyond doubt which form was intended, it is often necessary to make a judgment call. See, for example, l. 416 on <locus from="193r">193r</locus>, where the second initial <hi rend="italic">S</hi> in the series <hi rend="italic">Sir Sabyn of Surre</hi> is smaller than those on either side of it. The same is true of the capital form of <hi rend="italic">D</hi>; see, for example, l. 457 on <locus from="194r">194r</locus>, where each <hi rend="italic">d</hi> in the sequence <hi rend="italic">Of doughty dauid the Duk</hi> is slightly larger than the one preceding it. In such cases, judgment calls must be made based on relative size and the likelihood of a capital form being in that position (e.g., the start of a line or proper names).</p>
                                
                                <p>The lower case forms of some letters, including <hi rend="italic">h</hi>, <hi rend="italic">k</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> feature a distinctive short stroke at the bottom of the ascender that slants downward from left to right.</p>
                                
                                <p>While the text of <title>Siege of Jerusalem</title> reflects <persName>Frampton</persName>’s <placeName>London</placeName>-area dialect, Hanna-Lawton observe that "the text includes a substantial veneer of northern and north Midland forms" that likely derive from his exemplar.</p>

                                <p>Rubricated headings, incipts, explicits, and textual divisions. At the beginning of each text, and also at beginning of each book of <title>Historia destructionis Troie</title>, 4-line initials that are either blue or red with white highlighting on a gold leaf background and decorated with blue, red, and gold vines and buds. All blue and red highlighted in white. Additionally, numerous multiline blue initials with red pen flourishing extending into margins.</p>
                                <p>Red paraph signs with blue flourishing and blue paraphs with red flourishing; in items 1 and 2, these mark textual divisions, and in <title>Siege of Jerusalem</title> they divide the text into 8-line strophes. From <locus from="204r">204r</locus> to end, <persName>Frampton</persName> has left signs for paraphs, but they have not been realized; these have been transcribed with the ¶ symbol, but they remain uncolored in the display. On these same folios (i.e., <locus from="204r">204r</locus> and following), each initial touched in white or yellow, now barely visible to the naked eye, but clear under ultraviolet light. Irregularities in the eight-line patter of strophe divisions often demonstrate what must have been problems with Frampton's exemplar. For example, the strophe beginning at U.261 contains only seven lines due to the absence of HL.273, a line that C and D also lack, and thus one that is presumably missing in a shared ancestor of the <hi rend="italic">delta</hi> group. There are a number of such instances throughout, all documented with textual notes, where Frampton adds or subtracts lines from the normal 8-line pattern due to missing or rearranged lines from his exemplar. While the significant majority of strophes contain eight lines, some number six, seven, nine, ten, or twelve lines even though there is no apparent problem with the exemplar (e.g., strophes beginning at U.168, 700, 1140). These groups, which increase in frequency towards the end of the manuscript, have been encoded but not documented with textual notes.</p>
                                
                                <p>On <locus from="1r" to="1r">1r</locus>, a thin gold border surrounds the text. This is paralleled by a vine that alternates blue and red with leaves and offshoots in blue and red. At bottom corners, interwoven red and blue lines on a round, lobed gold background. At top corners, red and blue vines curl around a similar gold background. All red and blue highlighted with white. Similar borders accompany initials decorated with gold leaf throughout the book, but aside from <locus from="1r" to="1r">1r</locus> these feature the border on the left edge only, with vines extending across the top and bottom margins.</p>
                                
                                <p>Seven passus divisions are marked with rubricated headings that read <hi rend="italic">Primus Passus</hi>, etc. Initial letters following passus divisions are blue with red decorative work and are two to seven lines in height. The first passus designation is found at l. 180 which, as Hanna-Lawton note, implies that the first 179 lines are a prologue, an arrangement that they have taken to be authorial and included in their critical text.</p>
                                
                                <p>The material presentation of the poem in U is considerably more lavish than in any other surviving copy. This is likely related to the intended audience; the poem’s placement alongside two Latin histories suggests that the poem was received as a learned historical work by some readers, even though most of the surviving manuscripts place it alongside religious works. <persName>Millar</persName> notes that it may be inferred "from the fact that <title>The Siege of Jerusalem</title> is to be found with the two Latin histories in the same hand that the intended audience of the manuscript was well-educated and possessed more than the mere rudiments of Latin" (25), a view supported by the fact that at least one user made marginal annotations in Latin (<persName>Guddat-Figge</persName> 108).</p>
