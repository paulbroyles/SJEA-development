                        Bodleian Library, MS Laud Misc.656 (L)
                        England
                        Laud Misc. 656 is likely the
                            oldest of the manuscripts in the Siege of Jerusalem
                            corpus, rivaled only by perhaps the Princeton Taylor MS (P), as
                                Doyle notes when he attributes the poem "to the
                            fourteenth century with confidence, from the earliest-looking copy, in
                            Bodleian Laud misc. 656" (93). Hanna-Lawton concur, dating the
                            manuscript to the end of that century. Guddat-Figge erroneously dates it
                            to the middle of the fifteenth century.

                                Parchment


                                
                                    i + 133 folios
                                    210 x 150
                                        mm
                                

                                Foliation in both ink and pencil, both rather early. The
                                    foliation in ink numbers each leaf 1-5 and thereafter in
                                    intervals of 10 (i.e. ,10, 20, 30, etc.). At a later date,
                                    numbers were added in pencil to the unfoliated leaves by a
                                    second hand. In quire X, the second hand corrects an error in
                                    counting by his predecessor, striking through “110” and
                                    replacing it with the correct “111.” Note also that the first
                                    hand returns to number the final leaves of Booklet I
                                    individually, but misnumbers 113, 114, 115, and 116 due the
                                    earlier error at fol. 110. The later foliator strikes through
                                    these and uses 115a and 115b to reach number 116 at the same
                                    point as his predecessor.


                                 One parchment flyleaf precedes quire I. As Hanna-Lawton
                                    note, the codex contains two booklets, the first comprising ii +
                                    fols. 1-116 and the second comprising fol. 117 to the end. The
                                    following collation refers to the extant modern pencil
                                    foliation.

                                    the margin frequently cut away.

                            


                            

                                In Booklet I, bounding lines in brown ink on
                                    top, left, and bottom of text blocks; no rulings for individual
                                    lines. A few prickings, usually one hole at the juncture of the
                                    bounding lines, remain (e.g., fols. 11, 15, 39, and 51). No ruling or
                                    prickings in Booklet II. Ruled for 33-41 lines per leaf in
                                        Siege of Jerusalem, 37-46 lines per leaf in
                                        Piers Plowman, and 38-40 lines in Booklet II.
                                    In Booklet I, text block 175-180
                                        mm in height in Siege of Jerusalem
                                    and 170-180 mm in height in
                                        Piers Plowman; the width of the text block
                                    varies in both. In Booklet II, text block 170-180 mm in height, 120 mm in width.

                            
                        


                        
                            
                                The text is in an anglicana script using brown ink throughout,
                                    and is likely the work on one scribe. Russell-Kane believe the
                                    entire manuscript to be the work of the same scribe, whereas
                                    Hanna-Lawton note that one scribe copied Siege of
                                        Jerusalem with "perhaps a second for the remainder."
                                    There are no running heads in Siege of Jerusalem,
                                    but Piers Plowman features running heads starting
                                    on fol. 69 and going through until the end, e.g., “Dowel,”
                                    “Dobet,” and “Dobest.” The first few of these (58v to 63r)
                                    appear to have been added later; the rest are contemporary with
                                    the text. Corrections are sparse, with subpunction on fol.
                                        5r, erasures on 9r, and a few supralinear additions by the main
                                    scribe (e.g., folios 3v, 7v, 9r).
                                Kellogg's dissertation is an especially useful tool for the study
                                    of the dialect of Laud Misc. 656; whereas the dialect features
                                    of the other manuscripts are documented in appendices, the
                                    features of L are the focus of his dissertation and are
                                    discussed at great length. He concludes his work with a summary
                                    of the relationships of the dialects found in the manuscript,
                                    noting that L is the westernmost dialect of the group (Kellogg
                                    did not know of P or the Exeter fragment):
                                "On the whole the MSS are pretty consistent in displaying
                                        East Midland traits. Western features are mainly limited to
                                        one MS: L. It alone shows any retention of OE. eo as a
                                        rounded vowel. It alone has ȝo for 'she' or preserves OE. y
                                        as a rounded vowel in more than a score of instances. U has
                                        seventeen instances of this last; E had nine"
                                    (61).
                                Although Kellogg's documentation and characterization of L's
                                    dialect are accurate, his conclusion that L represents the
                                    dialect of the poet is much less convincing than Hanna-Lawton's
                                    argument for an authorial dialect from the Barnoldswick-Earby
                                    area (see xxvii and following).
                                In "Langland's Dialect," Medium Ævum 54 (1985)
                                        M. L. Samuels also comments on the
                                    dialect of the manuscript, although his focus is on the C text
                                    of Piers Plowman rather than SJ.
                                    He lists Laud Misc. 656 as originating in "north Oxfordshire,"
                                    offering as evidence the forms hure, hear; ȝo, she; myche, much;
                                    silf, self; þuder, thither; to gadres, together; forȝutte,
                                    forget; and laste, lest (p. 239 and n. 39). Hanna-Lawton cite
                                        Samuels in identifying the manuscript
                                    as the work of “northwest Oxfordshire scribes,” but it should be
                                    noted that in the brief list provided above the
                                        SJ scribe exhibits different forms from those
                                    found in Piers in three out of six instances:

                                        Plowman may illuminate the debate of whether more
                                    than one scribe worked on this manuscript, although some
                                    differences may of course be attributable to the exemplars. 
                            
                        





                        
                             There are few decorative features in the manuscript.
                                    Siege of Jerusalem has rubricated initials 3-5
                                lines in height at fols. 1v, 7v, 13v, and 16r. Piers has spaces and
                                guideletters for rubricated initials, e.g., 19v, 25r, but these have
                                not been realized; the same is true in Booklet II, e.g., fol. 119v.
                            
                        


                        
                            

                                15th c., English. Binding is 215
                                        mm in height and 170
                                        mm in width as measured center of spine to the
                                    fore edge. Bound in reddish brown calfskin, rebacked but
                                    otherwise original. Wooden boards, sloped at edges. Four raised
                                    bands as bound, rebacked spine utilizing original bands.
                                    Additionally, two slightly raised sewing structures, one at top
                                    and the other at bottom of spine, detectable. Flat spine.
                                    Turn-ins at front and back are raggedly cut, glued to boards
                                    with no endpaper or other coverings. Grooves with recessed
                                    leather thongs visible in both boards. The binding is not
                                    decorated. Remnants of a strap and clasp, including bits of
                                    metal, present on front cover. The strap apparently hooked to a
                                    metal piece at center of back cover, where there is now a hole
                                    and corresponding discoloration in the leather. Single vellum
                                    flyleaf in front only.

                                The binding and boards bear several ownership labels:

                                A small yellow paper label is attached to the spine, on which is
                                    written “MS Laud / Misc. 656” in modern handwriting.

                                Paper label, inside front cover, top left: “ S.C. 1059” (a

                                    and “Laud / 656”. Added to the right of “Laud” in pencil at a
                                    later date: “MISC”. According to the Summary Catalogue, F. 22
                                    refers to the old shelfmark: “In 1641, the Laudian MSS.
                                        were arranged in eleven compartments, lettered A-L,
                                        occupying the whole of the S.W. gallery at the Selden

                            Hanna-Lawton and Russell-Kane give accurate and thorough
                                descriptions of L, including information on its physical condition,
                                contents, collation, and hand. Guddat-Figge
                                gives a similar description, but notes that she wrote her entry
                                through reliance upon Coxe and Skeat and that she had not seen the
                                manuscript in person. Hopper and
                                    Zetterson offer descriptions in the context
                                of studies of other poems appearing in the manuscript, and their
                                descriptions are much less detailed than those of Hanna-Lawton and
                                    Guddat-Figge. Doyle
                                and Millar discuss the manuscript briefly. The
                                dialect of the manuscript is the focus of
                                    Kellogg's dissertation. Where it would
                                merely be redundant to repeat these works, I briefly summarize them
                                below.

                                Doyle notes when he attributes the poem "to the

                            manuscript to the end of that century. Guddat-Figge erroneously dates it
                            to the middle of the fifteenth century.</div><div class="support"><b>Support: </b>Parchment</div><div class="extent"><b>Extent: </b>i + 133 folios</div><div class="format"><b>Format: </b>210 x 150

                                    intervals of 10 (i.e. ,10, 20, 30, etc.). At a later date,
                                    numbers were added in pencil to the unfoliated leaves by a
                                    second hand. In quire X, the second hand corrects an error in
