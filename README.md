# Content Locations
* XML files for editions and descriptions: `/XSLT/xml/`
    * DO NOT manually update the files in `/public/xml/`; they are automatically generated by rake commands.
* XSLT files for displaying editions and descriptions: `/XSLT/`
    * (This directory also contains two XML files providing manifests for edition and description XML files; I believe `SJEADescrListforHTML.xml` and `SJEAListforHTML.xml` should be updated to add new witnesses.)
* HTML content (home pages and layouts): `/public/`
    * Page layouts and wrappers -- one per tab.
        * `index.html`: Content for site homepage; also provides layout and wrappers for all home pages (The Poem, About, How to Use, Partners and Acknowledgments, Terms and Conditions).
        * `manuscript.html`: Landing page for manuscripts view; also provides layout for manuscript transcription/description pages.
        * `search.html`: Search page. It doesn't appear likely that this file provides the layout for search results, but I can't currently confirm one way or the other.
        * `comparison.html`: Provides layout and wrappers for comparison content. No default content since selecting the tab defaults to the first lien.
        * **NOTE:** To update the page interface (tabs, footer, etc.), it appears to be necessary to modify all four of these files. Please note that I'm a Rails newbie, and it's possible that they're generated from a template so that the basic site framing, headers, etc. can be updated separately and the changes reflected in each of these files. However, my early searches suggest that content in `/public/` is static, and I haven't found facilities for generating pages apart from the search results. In any case, updating these files will work, and it's the way recent changes have been made.
    * Content for subpages under Home: `about.html`, `partners.html`, `terms.html`, `thepoem.html`, `use.html`
        * These aren't full HTML files, but fragments that will be slotted into the framework provided by `index.html` when requested.
