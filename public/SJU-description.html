            <a name="origdate"></a><div class="origdate"><b>Date: </b>The manuscript dates to the beginning of the fifteenth century. Our ability to date it with some confidence is aided by the fact that we know its scribe, Richard Frampton, and some details concerning his professional life as a London-, or perhaps Westminster-based copyist. Doyle informs us that Frampton worked in one of those locations "from at least 1402 to 1416 for Henry IV and V" (p. 93 and note 19).</div><a name="support"></a><div class="support"><b>Support: </b>Parchment</div><a name="extent"></a><div class="extent"><b>Extent: </b>207 folios</div><a name="format"></a><div class="format"><b>Format: </b>250 x 175 mm</div><a name="foliation"></a><div class="foliation"><b>Foliation: </b>Foliation in upper right corner, pencil, modern hand, begins on the first parchment flyleaf at the beginning of the book. On the lower right margin there is a foliation in units of ten that would be preferable if complete, as it does not count flyleaves and thus is more accurate – i.e., 21 should actually be 20, 41 should actually be 40, etc. This hand also numbers the first folio of the second and third texts as 139 and 186 respectively, which is correct. All references to the manuscript in this description and in this archive more broadly use the folio numbers found at the top right, however.</div><a name="collation"></a><div class="collation"><b>Collation: </b>

The main text block is 160-163 x 107-108 mm, and is ruled for 32 lines. Text block bounded in lead or brown ink with four lines that run to edge of leaf. Ruled lines generally stay within text block. Examples of unused ruled leaves may be seen at 185v-186v. No prickings.</span><br /><br />
                                </div><a name="handnote"></a><div class="handnote"><b>The scribe — script and dialect: </b>
                                <span class="p">One scribe throughout, using brown ink and an anglicana formata script, who has been identified as Peter Frampton, a professional scribe based in London. Guddat-Figge believed the manuscript to be the work of three scribes, an opinion that has not held up in subsequent analyses by Hanna-Lawton, Doyle, and Somerville, who believe it all to be the work of Frampton. Doyle and Parks (and, after them, Hanna-Lawton) list other manuscripts known to be by Frampton, which include "two enormous Coucher books" for the Duchy of Lancaster (now PRO D.L. 42, 1 and 2), a two-volume breviary for Henry IV, and Glasgow University Library, Hunterian MS T.4.1, which begins with the same two Latin histories as U. Hanna-Lawton add that Frampton is also responsible for portions of Huntington Library, MS HM 19920 and British Library, MS Cotton Claudius D.ii. For more on Frampton, see also Doyle and Parkes, "The Production of Copies of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> and the <i>Confessio Amantis</i> in the Early Fifteenth Century" (especially p. 192 and note 65) and Somerville, "The Cowcher Books of the Duchy of Lancaster.”</span><br /><br /> 
                                
                                <span class="p">The scribe uses a variety of typical suspensions and abbreviations. Lines generally begin with capital letter forms; initial letters that do not have a distinct lower case are likely intended as capitals, have been transcribed as they appear. The caesura is marked throughout with a slash and has been transcribed "/." There is a header reading <i>Incipit destruccio de Ier[usa]lem per Titum &amp; Vespasianu[m]</i>, but no running heads.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">While the text of <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i> reflects Frampton’s London-area dialect, Hanna-Lawton observe that "the text includes a substantial veneer of northern and north Midland forms" that likely derive from his exemplar.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                
                            </div><a name="deconote"></a><div class="deconote"><b>Decoration: </b>
                                <span class="p">Rubricated headings, incipts, explicits, and textual divisions. At the beginning of each text, and also at beginning of each book of <i>Historia destructionis Troie</i>, 4-line initials that are either blue or red with white highlighting on a gold leaf background and decorated with blue, red, and gold vines and buds. All blue and red highlighted in white. Additionally, numerous multiline blue initials with red pen flourishing extending into margins. Red paraph signs with blue flourishing and blue paraphs with red flourishing; in items 1 and 2, these mark textual divisions, and in <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i> they divide the text into 8-line passus divisions. From <a class="imglightbox" href="/U204r-lb.html">204r</a> to end, Frampton has left signs for paraphs, but they have not been realized; these have been transcribed with the ¶ symbol, but they remain uncolored in the display. On these same folios (i.e., <a class="imglightbox" href="/U204r-lb.html">204r</a> and following), each initial touched in white or yellow, now barely visible to the naked eye, but clear under ultraviolet light. On <a class="imglightbox" href="/U198r-lb.html">198r</a>, a couple of paraph marks are missing where we would expect them to occur at eight-line intervals. Rubricated passus headings in <i>SJ</i>.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">On 1r, a thin gold border surrounds the text. This is paralleled by a vine that alternates blue and red with leaves and offshoots in blue and red. At bottom corners, interwoven red and blue lines on a round, lobed gold background. At top corners, red and blue vines curl around a similar gold background. All red and blue highlighted with white. Similar borders accompany initials decorated with gold leaf throughout the book, but aside from 1r these feature the border on the left edge only, with vines extending across the top and bottom margins.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">Seven passus divisions are marked with headings that read <i>Primus Passus</i>, etc. Initial letters following passus divisions are blue with red decorative work and are two to seven lines in height. The first passus designation is found at l. 180 which, as Hanna-Lawton note, implies that the first 179 lines are a prologue, an arrangement that they have taken to be authorial and included in their critical text.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">The material presentation of the poem in U is considerably more lavish than in any other surviving copy. This is likely related to the intended audience; the poem’s placement alongside two Latin histories suggests that the poem was received as a learned historical work by some readers, even though most of the surviving manuscripts place it alongside religious works. Millar notes that it may be inferred "from the fact that <i>The Siege of Jerusalem</i> is to be found with the two Latin histories in the same hand that the intended audience of the manuscript was well-educated and possessed more than the mere rudiments of Latin" (25), a view supported by the fact that at least one user made marginal annotations in Latin (Guddat-Figge 108).</span><br /><br />
