             <p> <em>The Siege of Jerusalem</em> is an anonymous 14th-century English poem that describes
                 the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. The event upon which the poem is based - the
                 destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by Roman armies led by Titus - is of
                 enormous historical importance. The conflict deprived the Jewish people of an independent
                 nation, a desire that would go unrealized until the establishment of the modern state
                 of Israel during the twentieth century, led to a shift of Judaism from a temple-based to
                 a rabbinic, synagogue-based faith, and contributed significantly to the emergence of
                 Christianity as a religion associated with Rome rather than in relation to the temple-based
                 practices of Judaism in which Christianity had its roots. As told in this 14 th-century poem,
                 however, these events are highly anachronistic; the poem features a Roman army led
                 by Titus and his son Vespasian, recent converts to Christianity who want to avenge the
                 death of Christ by destroying Jerusalem and forcing the Jewish people to repent. The real
                 historical reasons for the war - withheld taxes and a revolt in Judea - are to be found in the
                 poem as well, but are emphasized far less than the anachronistic religious rationale given
                 by the poem's protagonists.</p>

              </br>

             <p> The poem uses the alliterative long line, a verse form that employs alliteration as the
                 basis of metrical structure and that was used in many of the masterpieces of late medieval
                 literature, including <em>Piers Plowman, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em>, and the Alliterative
                 <em>Morte Arthure</em>. These poems were examples of a flourishing, if brief, literary movement
                 known as the Alliterative Revival. <em>The Siege of Jerusalem</em> survives today in nine manuscript
                 copies, some of which are partial copies, a number that makes it the second-largest corpus
                 of alliterative long line poetry; the largest, at more than fifty copies, is <em>Piers Plowman</em>.</p>

             <p> <em>The Siege of Jerusalem Electronic Archive</em> presents full transcriptions and accompanying
                 color images of all surviving manuscript versions of the poem, detailed descriptions of
                 the manuscripts, and tools for searching and comparing texts and accompanying critical
                 materials. These materials are made available under agreement with partner libraries, and
