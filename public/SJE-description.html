In "Putting It Right," Turville-Petre, citing Hanna, suggests a date of around 1410 for most of the manuscript, but a date of around 1435 for <i>The Siege of Jerusalem</i>: "It seems that the manuscript remained in that state for perhaps a quarter of a century when Hand 5, spotting blank leaves at the end of the final quire, began the <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i> on the lower half of the last leaf of <i>Piers</i> and added two new quires" (44).</div><a name="support"></a><div class="support"><b>Support: </b>Parchment</div><a name="extent"></a><div class="extent"><b>Extent: </b>i+219+i folios</div><a name="format"></a><div class="format"><b>Format: </b>240 x 170 mm</div><a name="foliation"></a><div class="foliation"><b>Foliation: </b>Foliation in pencil, modern hand, top right corner, is accurate.

                                <span class="p">One scribe, using an anglicana script and brown ink, is responsible for the entire text of <i>The Siege of Jerusalem</i>. The script begins small and gets even more compressed as the text continues. As many as six scribes worked on the manuscript, however, and their division of work has been the subject of considerable scholarly attention. This is discussed fully in <i>The Piers Plowman Electronic Archive 6</i>, from which I quote at length here:</span><br /><br /> 
                                <span class="p">“The most probable sequence of composition is that Hand A began his work with <i>Piers Plowman</i>, copying the first quire (ff. 113-20) and making a start on the second (fol. 96r), before abruptly handing over to Hand B (ff. 96r-v, 95r) while he himself copied <i>The Prick of Conscience</i> (ff. 1r-94r). But Hand B soon abandoned his work on <i>Piers Plowman</i>, and the blank leaves were incorporated into the final quire of <i>The Prick of Conscience</i> (as ff. 89r-90r) in such a way that the <i>Piers Plowman</i> fragment Hm<sup>2</sup> became the wrapper of that section of the manuscript. The bottom right edge of folio 96v has lost text (affecting the last 12 lines of Hm<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to Hm.3.38-49) either through erasure (as though someone had started to clean the page for new text) or more probably through rubbing. While Hand A copied <i>The Prick of Conscience</i>, Hand D completed <i>Piers Plowman</i> (ff.121r-205r). Hand A rubricated <i>The Prick of Conscience</i> himself, but rubrication of <i>Piers Plowman</i> is in another hand. Some years after <i>Piers Plowman</i> was completed, Hand E began the <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i> on the lower half of the same leaf (ff. 205r-216r), and when the <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i> was finished, hand F began <i>The Good Wife</i> on the verso (ff. 216v-219r). The third text in the volume <i>Expositio sequentiarum</i> has no necessary connection with the rest of the volume in origin, since it is two independent quires (ff. 97r-112v) copied by a scribe C whose work appears nowhere else in the manuscript.”</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">Punctuation within <i>Siege of Jerusaelm</i> is sparse. Lines generally begin with capital letter forms; initial letters that do not have a distinct lower case are likely intended as capitals, but have been transcribed as they appear. The caesura is usually, but not always, marked by a simple punctus. Some lines have no medial punctuation, but there is no discernible reason for this occasional omission.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">The scribe uses a variety of typical suspensions and abbreviations and, despite the messiness of his script, offers little in the way of difficulties of interpretation or unusual forms. The text features a number of erasures, some of which are the work of a later corrector, who has been tagged with the designation <i>hand x</i>. In two instances on <a class="imglightbox" href="/E206v-lb.html">fol. 206v</a> the scribe left blank spaces, one a little over half a line in size and the other large enough to accommodate a quatrain. These were completed in a later stint, probably by the original scribe working with lighter ink and perhaps a different pen, a fact that suggests that he consulted more than one exemplar. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this scribe is the relationship of his role to the others who worked on Hm 128, "a complex manuscript containing several interrelated texts and involving a number of collaborating scribes probably in a religious house" (Turville-Petre 43). <i>Prick of Conscience</i> and <i>Piers Plowman</i>, the first texts copied, were written in clear, attractive hands, but later both texts were "defaced by a multitude of corrections on every page," and the unattractive <i>Siege</i> text is "followed by <i>The Good Wife</i> in a remarkably large and sprawling hand" (44). There is no indication that the scribe of <i>SJ</i> was involved in the corrections of the earlier texts, nor is it clear how much time lapsed between the copying of <i>Piers</i> and <i>Prick of Conscience</i> and the extensive revising. At any rate, it is clear that the volume began as a rather attractive and competently copied one, and that the undisciplined hand of the <i>SJ</i> scribe was one of a number of later additions that resulted in it ending up as a rather messy and defaced one. It is also interesting to note that the scribe presented here produced the least accurate and least metrical copy of the <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>. His text, filled with mistakes, omissions, additions, and unmetrical lines, seems as haphazard as his hand. What it lacks in ability to convey authorial design, however, it makes up for in presenting a good model of scribal recomposition as well as later scribal correction and alteration of the text.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">LALME, LP 6910 grid 423 238,provides a linguistic analysis of the manuscript that, unlike other analyses of manuscripts containing <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i> included in the atlas, is based on linguistic data from <i>SJ</i> itself rather than from other works in the codex. The editors place the scribe in south Warwickshire, which is close to the dialects of the other scribes in the book. See T<i>he Piers Plowman Electronic Archive 6</i>, section IV, “Linguistic Description,” for a full description of the dialect of <i>Piers Plowman</i> and a discussion of previous dialect studies. Hanna-Lawton note that the cluster of Warwickshire dialects found in neighboring texts might suggest production in a communal religious environment (xxiv).</span><br /><br />

Both front and back blind tooled in similar fashion. The perimeter of the boards outlined by a fillet with a more narrow fillet running parallel to and just inside of this outer perimeter. This pairing of one broader and one more narrow fillet repeated both as horizontal lines approximately 30 mm from bottom and top and as vertical lines set in approximately 20 mm from fore edge and spine, with the result being the creation of a series of compartments formed by these perpendicular lines. In the center a panel rectangular frame is created by use of a roll that Dutschke identifies as "of Oldham's class HM.a (17-23)."  Inside of this, another pairing of wide and narrow fillet. A tool featuring a flower and leaf motif has been used to decorate each corner within the rectangle formed within the roll pattern, and this tool has been repeated four times on an axis to make a design at the very center of the boards. Lines have been tooled at an angle on either side of each raised band in such a manner that these lines intersect approximately 35mm in from the spine. </span><br /><br />

Dutschke identifies these pastedowns as being from late 14th c. and in anglicana script. Two inscriptions at the bottom of the front pastedown are discussed below, as well as in <i>The Piers Plowman Electronic Archive 6</i>, section I.11. At the bottom of rear pastedown is a gold star and, written in pencil, <i>HM 128 V4D6</i>. Both recto of front flyleaf and verso of rear flyleaf contain arabic numerals, perhaps mathematical calculations. On the recto of the front flyleaf are the bookplates of Ross Winans and the Earl of Ashburnham. Winans' bookplate is now adhered only on the left edge. It looks as if it had previously been pasted over most of the 16th-century signature Richard Rychard. Ashburnham's bookplate reads <i>From the Library of the Earl of Ashburnham Appendix No. CXXX May 1897</i>. The label is printed with the exception of <i>CXXX</i>, which is written into a blank printed for that purpose. Written in pencil on the recto of flyleaf ir is <i>Catl A No 175</i>; on the verso is written in blue pencil <i>A catal. 130</i>. The verso also features a table of contents dated 1751 that lists the texts in order and the number of leaves that each text comprises.</span><br /><br />

                            <span class="p">1. As described above, the dialect and composition of the manuscript suggest that the manuscript was made in a communal religious setting in Warwickshire. Hanna-Lawton suggest Alcester (OSB) or Evesham (worcs., OSB) as possibilities (xxiv).</span><br /><br />
                            
                            <span class="p">2. The bottom of the front pastedown includes two inscriptions. The first reads <i>Robert or William langeland made pers ploughman</i>, and has been identified as likely being the hand of Ralph Coppinger, a knight of Davington who died in 1551 (<i>PPEA 6</i>, I.11). A second inscription, <i>Robertus Langlande natus in comitatu Salopie in villa Mortymers Clybery in the claylande, within .viij. myles of Malborne Hylles scripsit, Peers Ploughman, li. i / In somer season whan set was sunne</i>, is in the hand of John Bale (d. 1563), author of <i>Index Britanniae Scriptorum</i>. This attribution has been discussed extensively in the critical literature; see <i>PPEA 6</i> and Dutschke’s description (p. 163) for details.</span><br /><br />
                            
                            <span class="p">3. In 1751, the list of contents on the verso of the front flyleaf was added. As Dutschke notes, a number of annotations in the same hand may be found throughout the manuscript. Perhaps the most telling of these occurs on fol. 92 at line 9138 of <i>The Prick of Conscience</i>, where we find written <i>The other MS ends here</i>. This likely refers to British Library, Egerton 657, which begins lacks the beginning of the poem and begins at that line. Since both Egerton 657 and HM 128 once belonged to Adam Clarke, this suggests that these books were purchased together from a previous owner by Clarke (Dutschke 163).</span><br /><br />
                            
                            <span class="p">4. Adam Clarke (1760?-1832), is the first owner whose identity we know with certainty. The book is listed as item <i>CXXIX</i> in <i>Catalogue of the Collection of Dr. Adam Clarke</i>.</span><br /><br />
                            
                            <span class="p">5. From there, Dutschke traces a quick succession of owners leading to the purchase of the book in 1918 by Henry E. Huntington:</span><br /><br />
                            
                            <span class="p"><i>Both Egerton 657 and HM 128 belonged to Adam Clarke (1760?-1832); HM 128 in the <i>Catalogue of the Collection of Dr. Adam Clarke</i>, complied by J. B. B. Clarke (London 1835) pp. 69-70, n. CXXIX (this number on the spine); his sale, Sotheby’s, 20 June 1836, lot 352 to Thorpe; Thorpe Catalogue (1836) Suppl. n. 509. Acquired by Clifton W. Loscombe before 1838 (when F. Madden used it for his edition of art. 6); his sale, Sotheby’s, 19 June 1854, lot 1167 to Upham for the fourth Earl of Ashburnham (1797-1878); see the <i>Catalogue of the Manuscripts at Ashburnham Place</i> (London n.d.), Appendix, n. CXXX; Ashburnham sale, Sotheby’s, 1 May 1899, lot 78 to Quaritch; Quaritch Catalogue 193 (1899) n. 54. In January 1918 Henry E. Huntington selected this and other books from the collection of Ross C. Winans, at the time in the hands of G. D. Smit (163).</i></span><br /><br />
                            
                            <span class="p">A number of other names also occur throughout the manuscript. On 149r is written <i>betou(n) bryg(es)</i>, and 153r <i>Maude</i>, each in a 15th-century hand (probably the same hand) and written perpendicular to the text in the right margin. At the top of 101r in ink, <i>Aleksander London</i> (or Loudon) in 15th- or 16th-century hand. At the bottom of 144v, in probably a 16th-c. hand, <i>cysley</i>. <i>Richard Rychard</i>, 16th c., on ir. On back pastedown, also <i>Richard</i>, but in a different hand, either 16th- or 17th-c.. Also on the back pastedown, on the right edge, <i>John Sarum</i>(?). The same hand that wrote <i>Richard</i> on the back pastedown has written <i>shall recyue</i>(?) beneath <i>John Sarum</i>.</span><br /><br />
