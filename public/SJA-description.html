            <a name="origdate"></a><div class="origdate"><b>Date: </b>Mid-fifteenth century. Analysis of the watermarks contained in Additional 31042 has permitted scholars, including Robert Thompson and Ralph Hanna, to establish a range of dates for the composition of the manuscript and has provided evidence of a long and complex history of compilation. In providing a date for the manuscript, Hanna-Lawton summarize the evidence provided in Thompson's list of watermarks (see <i>Robert Thornton and the London Thornton Manuscript</i>, pp. 71-3) stating that "the most narrowly datable of these fall within the period 1437-50."</div><a name="support"></a><div class="support"><b>Support: </b>Paper</div><a name="extent"></a><div class="extent"><b>Extent: </b>vii + 179 + viii folios</div><a name="format"></a><div class="format"><b>Format: </b>270-275 x 200 mm</div><a name="foliation"></a><div class="foliation"><b>Foliation: </b>Foliation in pencil, modern hand, top right of rectos. Parchment flyleaves in front are numbered 1, 2, and in rear are numbered 182, 183. Remaining stubs of lost leaves between fols. 110 and 111 are not accounted for in the foliation. An alternate foliation on the lower left of rectos is preferable in that it does not count the flyleaves as folios, but it is not visible on all leaves and is not the foliation used in published discussions of the manuscript. Because this foliation counts the two stubs between 110 and 111 but not the two parchment flyleaves in the front, it is identical with the later foliation from fol. 111 forward.</div><a name="collation"></a><div class="collation"><b>Collation: </b> 
                                    <span class="p">Collation of the manuscript is significantly hindered by the fact that leaves are mounted on singletons, presumably as a consequence of rebinding at the British Library. A history of collations is offered by Thompson (p. 19), and includes Karen Stern (1976), Sarah M. Horrall (1979), Hanna (1984), and Thompson himself (1987). Thompson establishes a collation of the manuscript based in large part upon the sequence of watermarks; a complete list is provided on pages 71-3, including a range of known dates for each stock. Thompson’s collation is as follows:</span><br /><br />

                                    <span class="p">As the collations attest, even after exhaustive study many uncertainties remain. Taken together, they point to the persistent trouble areas, beginning with the fifth quire and continuing to the end, in establishing a collation.</span><br /><br />
                                    
                                    <span class="p">In "The Growth of Robert Thornton's Books," <i>Studies in Bibliography</i> 40 (1987), pages 51-61, Hanna establishes the likely order and method of the compilation of Additional 31042 and Lincoln Cathedral MS. 91, the only other known manuscript copied by Thornton. Watermark evidence points to both the London and Lincoln manuscripts being copied gradually over a period of many years.</span><br /><br />
                                    
                                </div><a name="condition"></a><div class="condition"><b>Condition: </b>In sound condition, but with numerous areas of damage and repairs throughout.</div><a name="layout"></a><div class="layout"><b>Page layout: </b>Bounded in brown ink. Writing area in <i>SJ</i> varies slightly, usually c. 220 x 120 mm. Horizontal and vertical bounding lines extend to margins. No prickings, not ruled. A similar layout for other texts throughout, although many texts are laid out in two columns, and each column is then bounded but not ruled. Some leaves bounded in red ink instead of brown (e.g., fols 125-143).</div><a name="handnote"></a><div class="handnote"><b>The scribe — script and dialect: </b>
                                <span class="p">The manuscript is in the hand of Robert Thornton, a member of the minor gentry from East Newton in North Yorkshire.</span><br /><br /> 
                                
                                <span class="p">Thornton's hand is an anglicana script that Guddat-Figge describes as "careless Anglicana, greatly varied" (159), Hanna-Lawton describe as "sprawling and ill-formed" (xvi), and Thompson a bit more generously deems "typical of much fifteenth-century book production as well as many documents and official records of the period" (3). The variance in the script noted by Guddat-Figge led a number of earlier scholars to conclude that the manuscript may be the work of more than one scribe, but, according to Thompson, these claims were "effectively countered" by Stern's analysis of the London manuscript, and later by M. B. Parkes, who "confirmed that, regardless of variations in the shape, size and degree of formality of the script, the Thornton scribe was solely responsible for the fifteenth-century material in the Lincoln manuscript as well" (3). Thornton uses black ink throughout, with some stints lighter than others.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">Punctuation in the manuscript is sparse. Lines generally begin with capital letter forms; initial letters that do not have a distinct lower case are likely intended as capitals. There is no medial punctuation.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">The dialect of Additional 31042 is northern, a fact that should come as no surprise given that Thornton’s Yorkshire home. The manuscript, or at least the text of <i>SJ</i>, contains the usual hallmarks of a northern dialect, including the retention of OE long <i>a</i> in words such as <i>twa</i>, l. 134, <i>maa</i> l. 127, and <i>sa</i>, l. 57, and the preference for <i>-es</i> and lack of <i>-eth</i> for the present indicative plural inflection. Kellogg's dissertation provides a thorough accounting of the dialect features of the manuscript, many of which are unique within the <i>SJ</i> corpus.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><a href="/A050r-lb.html">Folio 50r</a> contains a header reading <i>Hic InCepit Distruccio Ierarusalem Quomodo Titus &amp; vaspasianus Obsederundt &amp; distruxerunt Ierusalem et vidicarunt mortem domini Iesu christi</i>, and below that <i>The Segge of Ierusalem Off Tytus and vaspasyane</i>. There are no running heads. Marginalia is sparse within the portion of the manuscript devoted to <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>; <i>Virionyke</i> is written in the right margin of <a href="/A052r-lb.html">fol. 52r</a> and <i>Nyght</i> at the top of <a href="/A051r-lb.html">51r</a>, and there are inscriptions at the bottoms of fols. <a href="/A054r-lb.html">54r</a> and <a href="/A061r-lb.html">61r</a>, the latter being rather unclear and faded. The poem ends with the colophon <i>Explicit la sege de Ierusalem</i> and, beneath that is signed <i>R. Thornton dictus qui scripsit sit benedictus amen</i>. Thornton's signature also appears on <a href="/A050r-lb.html">fol. 50r</a> at the end of <i>Passio Domini nostri Ihesu Christi</i>.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">For biographical information on Robert Thornton, see Thompson pp. 2-5, and Robert Keiser's two articles on Thornton's life, "Lincoln Cathedral Library MS 91: Life and Milieu of the Scribe," and "More Light on the Life and Milieu of Robert Thornton.” See Stern's article for a detailed discussion of Thornton's script, and Mary Hamel, "Scribal Self-Corrections in the Thornton <i>Morte Arthure</i>” for a discussion of Thornton's corrections and his fidelity to his copy text. Although Hamel's article focuses on the Lincoln MS, her discussion of Thornton's scribal and editorial tendencies is pertinent to the London MS as well, especially since Thornton seems to have worked on the two books simultaneously.</span><br /><br />

The illustration features two heads, one a man's and the other a woman's, peering out from the left side of the initial capital <i>I</i> and an animal head at the top of the letter that Thompson colorfully describes as "a grotesque face with pointed ears and malevolent features which bear an obvious resemblance to the pig-like features on f. 33r" (58). The illustration seems to have no overt connection to the content of the poem. It is one of two occurring in the manuscript, the other, which accompanies the <i>Northern Passion</i>, being a drawing of a man's head with a crown and an animal figure on fol. 33r, both enclosed in vines, and what appears to be an incomplete lion's head at the top of that folio. As both Thompson and Guddat-Figge note, a blank space left at the top of fol. 24v suggests that room was left for an additional illustration.</span><br /><br />

Lines 427, 616, 872, and 1083 correspond not only to other manuscripts, but to what Hanna-Lawton take to be authorial structural divisions in the poem. In addition, before each of these four lines there is a textual gap approximately one line in height in which is written, centered, <i>Passus</i>.</span><br /><br />

An oval paper label near top of spine reads <i>682</i>, while one near bottom of spine reads <i>C</i>. Edges of leaves sprinkled/marbled with red from an earlier binding. Inside back cover, a stamp on lower left reads <i>24 JAN 1972</i>, presumably the date of the binding. A <i>Record of Treatment, Extraction, Repair, etc.</i> slip affixed to a rear flyleaf notes that the book was examined after binding on 3.2.72 There are three sets of flyleaves front and back. The outermost are four paper flyleaves each, and are modern paper from the 1972 rebinding. There is also one paper flyleaf both front and back, presumably from the 19th-c. British Museum binding, now mounted as singletons on stubs. In both front and back are also two parchment flyleaves, each still an intact bifolium.</span><br /><br />

                    </div><a name="provenance"></a><div class="provenance"><b>Provenance: </b> Ownership of the manuscript after it passed from Robert Thornton's hands is unclear until 1879, at which time an anonymous American owner sent the manuscript to the London bookseller J. Pearson, who sold it to the British Museum (Thompson 7). Fol. 49r contains the signature <i>John Nettletons boke</i>, and <i>Nettylton</i> or <i>Netylton</i> appear several times on fol. 139v; Thompson suggests that this is likely "[o]ne of the two John Nettletons of Hutton Cranswick in the East Riding" (6). Fol. 73v contains the signature <i>willia[m] frost</i> in a fifteenth-century hand. For a detailed discussion of the manuscript's provenance, see Thompson pp. 5-7.

This is due in part to its contents, which in addition to <i>SJ</i> include the only surviving copy of <i>Wynnere and Wastoure</i>, works by Lydgate, two Charlemagne Romances entitled <i>The Sege of Melayne</i> and <i>Duke Rowlande and Sir Otuell of Spain</i>, and a copy of <i>The Parlement of the Thre Ages</i>. Interest in the manuscript is also due in part to its composition, as there has been much critical discussion of its scribe, Robert Thornton, and Lincoln Cathedral Library MS 91, another surviving miscellany in his hand that contains eighty works, including many important romances.</div>
