    <p><em>The Siege of Jerusalem</em> is an anonymous 14th-century English poem that describes the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD.
       While we possess no conclusive evidence of the date of its composition, it must have been written after John of Tynemouth’s <em>Historia aurea</em>,
       which dates to around 1350 and which the Siege poet used as a source (for a discussion of the relationship of this work to <em>The Siege of Jerusalem</em>,
       see Andrew Galloway, “Alliterative Poetry in Old Jerusalem,” <em>Medieval Alliterative Poetry: Essays in Honour of Thorlac Turville-Petre</em>, pp. 85-106),
       and it must have been written before the copying of Bodleian Library, MS Laud Misc. 656, which dates to the final decade of the 14th century
       (see the <a href="/manuscript.html?description=SJL">Description of L</a> for more information). Ralph Hanna and David Lawton, whose critical edition of the poem was published in 2003 by The Early English
       Text Society (o.s. 320) argue that “composition during the 1370s or 1380s would seem an appropriate and conservative inference” (xxxv).
       They also provide a detailed study of the author’s dialect, and argue that it may be restricted to “a small area in the West Riding of Yorkshire,
       a neighbourhood centred around Barnoldswick and Earby” (xxix).

    <p>The poem uses the alliterative long line, a verse form that employs alliteration as the basis of metrical structure and that was used in many of the
       masterpieces of late medieval literature, including <em>Piers Plowman, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em>, and the Alliterative <em>Morte Arthure</em>.
       These poems were examples of a flourishing, if brief, literary movement known as the Alliterative Revival. <em>The Siege of Jerusalem</em> survives today
       in the nine manuscript copies (some of which are partial) presented in this electronic archive, a number that makes it the second-largest corpus of
       alliterative long line poetry; the largest, at more than fifty copies, is <em>Piers Plowman</em>.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>The poet relies primarily on three source texts: <em>Vindicta Salvatoris</em>, a Latin text dating to around the beginning of the eighth century that relates
       the story of Veronica’s veil and the miraculous healing of Titus; John of Tynemouth’s <em>Historia aurea</em>, an encyclopedic history; and Roger D’Argenteuil’s
       <em>Bible en François</em>. These sources, in turn, are themselves complex amalgamations of earlier texts; John of Tynemouth uses Ranulph Higden’s <em>Polychronicon</em>
       (itself a universal history indebted to other texts), Jacob of Voragine’s </em>Legenda Aurea</em>, and Hegesippus’ Latin translation of Josephus’ account of the
       Roman destruction of Jerusalem, while Roger D’Argenteuil fuses material from numerous religious texts, including the <em>Gospel of Nicodemus</em>, Veronica legends,
       <em>La Queste del Saint Graal</em>, and others (see Bonnie Millar, <em>The Siege of Jerusalem in its Physical, Literary, and Historical Contexts</em>, pp. 56-60 for a fuller
       discussion of Roger’s sources).

    <br />

    <p>The event upon which the poem is based – the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by Roman armies led by Titus – is of enormous historical importance.
       The conflict deprived the Jewish people of an independent nation, a desire that would go unrealized until the establishment of the modern state of Israel
       during the twentieth century, led to a shift of Judaism from a temple-based to a rabbinic, synagogue-based faith, and contributed significantly to the
       emergence of Christianity as a religion associated with Rome rather than in relation to the temple-based practices of Judaism in which Christianity had its roots.
       As told in this 14th-century poem, however, these events are highly anachronistic; the poem features a Roman army led by Titus and his son Vespasian,
       recent converts to Christianity who want to avenge the death of Christ by destroying Jerusalem and forcing the Jewish people to repent.
       The real historical reasons for the war – withheld taxes and a revolt in Judea – are to be found in the poem as well, but are emphasized far less
       than the anachronistic religious rationale given by the poem’s protagonists.

    <p>The genre of <em>The Siege of Jerusalem</em> is difficult to pin down; it has elements of romance,
       history, and religious verse, and is based on source texts that exhibit similar diversity.
       While the nine copies of the poem is not a particularly large corpus, it is quite large for
       poems from the Alliterative Revival. The outlier of this group is <em>Piers Plowman</em>, which
       survives in over fifty copies; the next largest is this collection of manuscripts, and other
       poems from this group survive in only one or two copies. This small corpus of nine
       manuscripts, which date from the late fourteenth century through the late fifteenth
       century, provides evidence that the question of genre - and thus of how the poem should
       be received - was unsettled even in the medieval era. In three of these manuscripts - L, P,
       and E - <em>The Siege of Jerusalem</em> occurs alongside texts that are mostly religious in nature,
       including copies of <em>Piers Plowman</em> in both L and E. In U and D, the text occurs alongside
       historical and chivalric works, including accounts of the destruction of Troy, a romance
       of Alexander the Great, the prose <em>Brut</em>, and <em>The Awntyrs of Arthure</em>. Both A and C are
       miscellanies; A contains a number of other alliterative poems, including <em>The Parlement
       of the Thre Ages</em> and <em>Wynnere and Wastoure</em> as well as religious works, and C contains
       a number of poems by Lydgate, religious verse, and chivalric romances. V is a fragment
       containing the prose <em>Three Kings of Cologne</em> (the verse version appears in A) and Latin
       tracts on the calendar and medicine. the contents of each manuscript are listed in full in the
       descriptions.

    <p>The poem has been the subject of a small, but growing, body of criticism. The poem’s early critics tended to dismiss the work
       on the grounds of the poet’s alleged zeal for suffering and rank anti-Judaism; Dorothy Everett claimed that the poet’s
       “ghoulish relish for the horrible is so marked that one feels it may account for his having chosen the siege as his subject,”
       while Derek Pearsall saw in the poem “an accomplished brutality of the visualizing imagination” and “a crude and narrow vindictiveness.”
       Recent critical opinion has been mixed concerning the poet’s stance towards the violent subject matter of his source texts and how and why
       he deploys these in his own work, resulting in a rough division between those who see sympathy or antipathy on the part of the author.
       It is my hope that the <em>Siege of Jerusalem Electronic Archive</em> can contribute to what has been a recent increase in scholarly interest in
       the work by providing access to all surviving evidence of the transmission and reception of the poem in manuscript copies
       (for a fuller discussion of the goals of this archive, see Timothy L. Stinson, “Makeres of the Mind: Authorial Intention, Editorial Practice,
       and <em>The Siege of Jerusalem,” The Yearbook of Langland Studies</em> 24 (2010), pp. 39-62).
