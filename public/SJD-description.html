                                <span class="p">One scribe throughout, using brown ink and an anglicana script. The scribe is known to have been a London professional who was also responsible for Huntington Library, MS Hm 114, most of British Library, MS Harley 3943, and parts of City of London Record Office, Letter Book I and the London <i>Liber Albus</i>; see Hanna-Lawton pp. xxi-xxii for details. Rubricated running heads by the main scribe throughout much of manuscript. In <i>Brut</i>, these list the reigning monarch who corresponds to the chronological history in the text. In <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>, <i>þe sege</i> written on versos, <i>of Ier[usa]l[e]m</i> written on rectos. In <i>Three Kings of Cologne</i>, <i>The kynges</i> or <i>þre kynges</i> on versos, <i>of Coloyne</i> on rectos. No running heads for items four and five.</span><br /><br /> 
                                
                                <span class="p">Punctuation in the manuscript is sparse. Lines generally begin with capital letter forms; initial letters that do not have a distinct lower case are likely intended as capitals. The caesura is marked for the first twenty-four lines by a vertical slash mark (transcribed "|"), but thereafter is not marked.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">The scribe uses a variety of typical suspensions and abbreviations, and presents little in the way of peculiar or problematic tendencies. He frequently bars <i>-ll</i> to indicate <i>-lle</i>. This is evident, for example, in the presence of barred <i>-ll</i> in <i>all</i> 45x, but unbarred <i>alle</i> 8x. There are a few self-corrections as well as a few corrections that seem to be the work of a later corrector, who uses a lighter-colored brownish ink; the latter have been identified in the archive by encoding them as the work of "hand x."</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">LALME (LP 6030, grid 578 190) considers Huntington MS Hm 114 along with British Library, Harley 3943, both by the same scribe responsible for Lambeth MS 491, and places the dialect near Rayleigh, Essex. As Hanna-Lawton note, Lambeth MS 491 "contains a variety of names scribbled in (s. xv<sup>2</sup>) . . . Perhaps most revelatory is Thomas Patsall's inscription on fol. 22<sup>v</sup>, 'in the tone of barakyng', that is, Barking, Essex" (xxii). Thus this brief fifteenth-century analysis of the dialect confirms LALME, as do the forms present throughout the text of <i>SJ</i> within MS 491. See also Doyle, p. 94 and n. 23, where he cites a conversation with M. L. Samuels, who also placed the dialect at Essex.</span><br /><br />
                                
                            </div><a name="deconote"></a><div class="deconote"><b>Decoration: </b>
                                <span class="p">As with most <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i> manuscripts, there are no illustrations and only modest ornamentation is present. The opening initial is a 2-line blue lombard flourished in red. Rubricated incipit. Extensive use of paraph markers, discussed further below, in red and blue. The first letter of some proper names touched in red – e.g., <i>Tytus</i>, <i>Gascoigne</i>, <i>Guyens</i> on <a class="imglightbox" href="/D206r-lb.html">fol. 206r</a>.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">Hanna-Lawton state that the scribe of MS 491 does not notate large-scale divisions of the text and thus they exclude the manuscript from the list of evidence for establishing authorial passus divisions (lxxi-lxxii). Although they are correct that D features "a scattered series of paraphs" (lxxi), they have missed the marginal instructions left by the scribe for the rubricator to mark large-scale divisions, some of which are obscured by these paraphs. Hanna-Lawton recognize divisions in their edition at lines 189, 305, 445, 637, 897, and 1113. In MS 491, each of these except one is in fact marked  by the scribe or there is a clear explanation as to why it is not marked: at HL 189 (D 182), there is a marginal notation in the brownish scribal ink that has been partly obscured by the red paraph<span class="graphic">I</span>; at HL 445 (D 429) a similar mark is visible beneath the blue paraph<span class="graphic">I</span>; HL 637 features no marginal notation, but appears at the top of a new quire on <a class="imglightbox" href="/D217r-lb.html">fol. 217r</a> at a point where there is an unusual blank space at the end of the previous quire, suggesting that the scribe was responding to a large-scale textual division in his exemplar (see Hanna-Lawton, lxxii, who recognize this as a likely site of a textual division); HL 897 (D 861) features a clear scribal notation to the left of a blue paraph<span class="graphic">I</span>; and HL 1113 (D 1070) is similarly marked but there is no paraph added later<span class="graphic">I</span>. This leaves only HL 305, which is not attested by D. Instead, however, the scribe adds a division at HL 953 (D 916), where the notation is written to the left of (and partly obscured by the blotting of) a blue paraph<span class="graphic">I</span>. This final division is also marked in E, but that evidence from E has been excluded by Hanna-Lawton on the grounds that it only occurs in only one manuscript (i.e., at E 953; see Hanna-Lawton p. lxxi).</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">The large-scale divisions of D, then, correspond exactly to those of E with two possible exceptions. The first is at HL 738, which E marks with a rubricated multiline capital. In D 711, which corresponds to HL 738, it is now impossible to tell if this line was marked because of the drastically cropped margin of <a class="imglightbox" href="/D218v-lb.html">fol. 218v</a> and the consequent damage to some of the initial letters of lines on that folio; if it were once marked, the mark would certainly have been lost. This seems the most likely case, however, since D corresponds to E elsewhere as far as large-scale textual divisions are concerned, and since HL 738, although not recognized as archetypal by Hanna-Lawton, is attested by U and C as well as E. The second exception is HL 1177, which E marks with another multiline capital. The rubricator of D supplied a paraph here as well, but there is no sign of the underlying <i>cc</i> by the scribe that I take to indicate the scribal divisions, and the rubricator supplied such a large number of meaningless paraphs that we must hold this one in doubt. The scribe of D uses the marginal notation described above just before the colophon as well, but otherwise he reserves it for the instances mentioned here.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">Finally, it is necessary to discuss the odd, and what seems rather haphazard, placement of paraphs in the text. In addition to the fact that the rubricator marked some but not all of the large-scale textual divisions with paraphs, obscuring some and placing the paraphs alongside but not over others, he also distributed other paraphs in a perplexing manner, as, for example, when he placed five on <a class="imglightbox" href="/D209r-lb.html">fol. 209r</a> alone, three of them within a five-line span. Another hand, perhaps somewhat later, added more paraphs in thin strokes with brown ink, the first of these appearing at l. 927 with quite a few more from there to the end. Many of these, e.g., lines 1005, 1088, 1132, are now badly faded, so much so that it is very difficult to see them without magnification. (Interestingly, most are easily visible on microfilm, suggesting that either this ink has faded since the microfilm images were made or that the process of making the images itself somehow amplified them.) These paraphs may be distinguished in the archive because they display in black as opposed to blue or red.</span><br /><br />
                                  
                                <span class="p">Elsewhere in the manuscript, decorative features are consistent with those found in <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>. Note that in several instances – <i>SJ</i>, <i>Awntyrs</i>, and <i>Book of Hunting</i>, decoration was begun at the start of the text, but not carried through to the end:</span><br /><br />

In these were recorded the prices, which James notes in his catalogue. Bill characterizes 491 as "the same style of binding," but does not list it as one of the books bound for Sancroft.
