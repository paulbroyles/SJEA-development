            <a name="origdate"></a><div class="origdate"><b>Date: </b>Second half of fifteenth century. Rickert argues for a <i>terminus a quo</i> of 1446 based on the presence of Lydgate's “The nyghtyngale.” The presence of <i>O mors quam amara est memoria tua</i> on fols. 57v-58r has also been considered in efforts to date the manuscript, as another copy of that poem in Harley 116 adds a verse memorializing Lord Cromwell, whose death in 1454 might thus suggest a later <i>terminus a quo</i>. But as Woolf (p. 340) and Foster (pp. 147-48) have argued, the added stanza in the Harley manuscript is likely not original to the poem, and consequently the poem cannot be used for dating Cotton Caligula A.ii. The list of kings found on fols. 109r-110v suggests a <i>terminus ad quem</i>, as the main “scribe has written only the first section, which ends before the reign of Edward IV, suggesting that the book was completed in 1460/1” (Foster 148). (Two additional hands continued to add to this list through as late as 1485, although their additions appear to have occurred after the book was complete.)  As Foster argues, the fact that one scribe is responsible for the book and worked on it until 1460/1 suggests that it was likely completed towards the end of the possible spectrum of 1446-1460/1 since the chronicle could not have been written all at once until a later date and “the manuscript seems to be a continuous production” (148). The present volume comprises two formerly separate books in the Cotton Library, Vespasian D. VIII and Vespasian D. XXI. The two books were bound together as Cotton Caligula A.ii by the end of the seventeenth century, as they appear as such in the 1696 catalogue of the Cotton collection. This description primarily concerns part I, i.e., the former Vespasian D. VIII. </div><a name="support"></a><div class="support"><b>Support: </b>Paper</div><a name="extent"></a><div class="extent"><b>Extent: </b>137 folios</div><a name="format"></a><div class="format"><b>Format: </b>210 x 145 mm, quarto format</div><a name="foliation"></a><div class="foliation"><b>Foliation: </b>Current foliation, in ink, upper right corners, includes two flyleaves at the beginning of the book.

Two flyleaves at the end of part I are numbered 140-141, and a parchment bifolium – presumably formerly serving as a pair of flyleaves preceding part II – is numbered 142-143.

                                <span class="p">One scribe throughout, except for a few later additions noted in list of texts below. A small script mixing anglicana and secretary forms. Running heads by the scribe throughout, frequently featuring title of text with an obelus on either side. Brown ink.</span><br /><br /> 
                                
                                <span class="p">Marginalia appear in only a few instances and serve to call attention to important details in the texts, usually proper names as at l. 903, <a class="imglightbox" href="/C120v-lb.html">fol. 120v</a>, where we find <i>no[ta]</i> in the left margin and <i>GABAA</i> in the right margin. The scribe uses a slightly more formal book hand for these than for the text of the poem. The text is not heavily corrected, although there are examples of overwriting, erasure, and deletion, all of which appear to be the work of the original scribe.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">The scribe has a number of peculiar or problematic tendencies that are worth noting, some of which create problems of interpretation or consistency in transcriptional policy:</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Otiose macrons</u>: On occasion, the scribe uses macrons that seem to have no bearing upon the spelling of the words they decorate. For example, <i>euen</i><div id="C440euen-popup" class="popup-div"><div id="C440euen" class="popup-image"></div></div><span src="C440euen" class="graphic">I</span> at l. 440, <a class="imglightbox" href="/C115r-lb.html">fol. 115r</a>, has a macron over the second vowel, but it is difficult to think that the scribe intended to expand to <i>eue[n]n</i> given that he spells the word <i>euen</i> with no macron elsewhere.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Otiose flourishes on <i>–t</i></u>: In a few instances, e.g. lines 3<div id="C3flourisht-popup" class="popup-div"><div id="C3flourisht" class="popup-image"></div></div><span src="C3flourisht" class="graphic">I</span> and 22<div id="C22flourish22-popup" class="popup-div"><div id="C22flourish22" class="popup-image"></div></div><span src="C22flourish22" class="graphic">I</span> on <a class="imglightbox" href="/C111r-lb.html">fol. 111r</a>, the letter <i>t</i> features an otiose flourish on the end.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Final <i>–n</i></u>: The scribe usually adds a large flourish on the letter <i>n</i> when it is the last letter in a word. The flourish curves up and back to the left, as in the words <i>downn</i> and <i>bowndon</i><div id="Cdownnbowndon-popup" class="popup-div"><div id="Cdownnbowndon" class="popup-image"></div></div><span src="Cdownnbowndon" class="graphic">I</span> on adjacent lines on <a class="imglightbox" href="/C111r-lb.html">fol. 111r</a>. At times this can cause confusion because it seems as if the tail may be functioning as a macron, thus, for example, altering the spelling in the example above to <i>bowndou[n]</i>. The evidence points towards the scribe intending nothing other than a flourish, and thus these features are ignored in the transcription. This can be particularly tricky in instances where the ink has faded from part of the tail, making it appear as if there is a free-floating macron above the word.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Barred letters</u>: The scribe frequently bars <i>-l</i>, <i>-ll</i>, and <i>-h</i>, but there is ample evidence that he does not do so to alter spelling. For example, the word <i>all</i> appears as <i>all</i> and <i>alle</i> both with and without barred <i>-ll</i>.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Thorn and <i>–d</i></u>: Thorn or <i>th</i> are sometimes used where one would expect the letter <i>d</i> and vice versa. Examples of this include <i>þefende</i> for <i>defende</i> (306), <i>brothe</i> for <i>brode</i> (434), <i>founþen</i> for <i>founden</i> (448), <i>de</i> for <i>þe</i> (473), <i>þonnther</i> for <i>þonnder</i> (519), and <i>shede</i> for <i>sheþe</i> (541). </span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Capital forms</u>: Some letters, particularly <i>s</i> and <i>v</i>, have no distinct capital forms and instead rely upon relative size of the letters to distinguish between capitals and lower cases. This presents a problem throughout, especially with the letter <i>s</i>, where there is a spectrum of letter sizes rather than a clear upper and lower case. In many cases, the decision of how to transcribe these forms – upper or lower case – could go either way.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Suspended <i>–ur</i></u>: The scribe often uses suspended <i>-ur</i> where <i>-er</i> would be expected, e.g., <i>ou[ur]</i> and <i>Eu[ur]</i>.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Distinguishing <i>v</i> from <i>u</i></u>: At l. 468, <a class="imglightbox" href="/C115v-lb.html">fol. 115v</a>, the scribe uses an internal <i>v</i> where he would usually use <i>u</i>, apparently to clarify the potential minim confusion of <i>mened</i> versus <i>meued</i>:</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><i>And myche of moyses lawe . he meved þat tyme</i></span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">Foster offers a detailed discussion of the manuscript’s dialectal evidence, which poses what he characterizes as a “challenging linguistic puzzle that has yet to be solved” (148). Forms from a wide variety of dialect areas – Yorkshire, the East Midlands, the West Midlands, East Anglia, Kent – may be found in the manuscript. Foster concludes that “the scribe employed a <i>Mischsprache</i>, and his dialect cannot be distinguished from the many dialects of his exemplars, many of which he may have transcribed with little dialectical alteration” (148). </span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">Hanna-Lawton, responding to McSparran’s report (pp. 24-5) that M. L. Samuels believed "that C's language is very mixed but shows strongest evidence of Kentish provenance," disagree based on an assessment of dialect within <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>:"[O]ur experience with the forms of <i>The Siege</i> would suggest that Samuels has in fact identified a substrate peculiar to the transmission of <i>Octavian</i>, perhaps a London-Essex text: within <i>The Siege</i> scarcely any form occurs that one would associate with Kent. Here rather, the scribe seems to have assimilated, probably from relicts in his archetype, a melange of various East Anglian forms, focused in no single area" (xxvi). Kellogg also evaluated C on a list of thirty dialect features and concluded that it was an East Midland dialect.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">While there are many features of an Eastern dialect present within <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>, there are also dialect features that point elsewhere, as well as a few unusual features within the corpus of <i>SJ</i> manuscripts that are worth noting and have not yet been noted elsewhere:</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><i>Use of <i>mon</i></i>: Although C usually has the spelling <i>man</i>, the spelling <i>mon</i> is found three times (lines 150, 338, 1157), a spelling that is found elsewhere only twice in P (lines 286 and 288). The rounding of OE <i>a</i> before nasals is a West Midlands trait, and thus does not fit with the preponderance of evidence placing C’s copy of <i>SJ</i> in East Anglia or the East Midlands. (Kellogg noted the appearance of mon in C, but did not know of the existence of P, and thus was unaware of this agreement.)</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Alliteration on <i>f</i> and <i>v</i></u>: There are no examples of initial <i>v</i> for OE initial <i>f</i>, the presence of which would support Samuels' argument for a Kentish provenance. C is unique among the <i>SJ</i> manuscripts, however, in alliterating <i>f</i> with <i>v</i>, as it does at lines 31, 243, 253, and 1328:</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">31 - <i>His fader vaspasiane ferly bytydde</i></span><br /><br />

                                <span class="p">At line 31, C is in agreement with UDE, but the group replaces <i>fadere of flesche</i>, which is found in other manuscripts, with <i>fader vaspasiane</i>. This might have been motivated by the fact that Vespasian had not yet been mentioned by name in the poem, and thus the introduction of the proper name here can be explained as a scribal effort – inherited by the UDEC group – to clarify the identity of Titus’s father. Given that there is no other alliteration of <i>f</i> with <i>v</i> in UDE, this might be explained as a failure of alliteration caused by an effort to clarify the text within this group.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">Both E and C appear to alliterate <i>f</i> and <i>v</i> by replacing <i>visage</i> with <i>face</i> at l. 253, but in the case of E this is not reliable evidence since E's alliteration is highly inconsistent (e.g., ten lines earlier at 243 C also has <i>face</i> against <i>visage</i> in all other manuscripts except E, but E reads <i>nose</i>).</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><i>Dialect and the shift of exemplar</i>: Hanna-Lawton have demonstrated that the scribe switched between two exemplars, using one throughout the process of copying and switching freely between it and a second from line 603 (HL line 621) to the end. No analysis of the effect of this shift on dialect analysis has yet been put forth, and thus it is of interest to note one dialect feature exclusive to the portion of the manuscript prior to line 603, as well as two features found only after line 603:</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">a. The only examples of the present indicative plural inflection <i>-eth</i> occur prior to the introduction of the second exemplar: l. 304 <i>assayleth</i> and l. 329 <i>seyþe</i>.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">b. After the introduction of the second exemplar, the sole example of the third person plural pronoun spelled <i>þem</i> occurs at l. 632. In addition, the only examples of third person singular, present indicative <i>-es</i> occur at l. 1102, <i>leues</i>, and at l. 1260, <i>proferes</i>.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">The present indicative plural <i>-eth</i> is a trait of Southern, Kentish, and West Midland dialects, whereas both the spelling <i>þem</i> and the present indicative <i>-es</i> are traits of Northern and Northeast Midland dialects. This suggests the possibility that the second exemplar was of a more northern dialect, albeit with the caveat that this evidence is slight and should be taken into account against the wide admixture of forms found throughout the manuscript.</span><br /><br />
                                
                            </div><a name="deconote"></a><div class="deconote"><b>Decoration: </b>
                                
                                <span class="p">A space two lines in height at the beginning of <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i> was left for an initial capital <i>I</i>, but the letter was never rendered (cf. fol. 17r, where the initial is also missing). The first letter of each line was touched in yellow, now almost entirely faded away.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">Passus divisions occur as marginalia in the main scribal hand, sometimes accompanied by one or more obeli. The text of <i>SJ</i> is divided into quatrains, each of which is marked with a paraph. The scribe has seven passus divisions, but only the last five of them are numbered; the first would not be marked since it coincides with the beginning of the poem and the second almost certainly occurred on the missing folio that contained HL lines 167-248. In addition to these divisions, there are three points where an unusually large and ornate capital in C coincides with a textual division in one or more other manuscripts. At l. 1000 (HL 1025), a large initial <i>N</i> corresponds with a four-line capital in V. There are also large initial capitals at lines 930 (HL 953) and 1150 (HL 1177) (again an <i>N</i> in each case). The first corresponds to a three-line capital in E, and the latter to both a three-line capital in E and a paraph marker in D. This is of particular interest because of the decision of Hanna-Lawton to omit lines 953 and 1177 of E and l. 1025 of V, along with all paraph markers from D, from consideration in determining textual divisions for their critical text on the grounds that they occur only in single manuscripts. These capitals in C present us with the difficult task of determining whether they are meant to indicate further textual subdivisions in C (in addition to the scribe's clearly marked passus headings), or simply to reflect breaks in the continuity of the narrative. In each case these large initials introduce the word <i>Now(e)</i> at a moment suggesting a turn in the narrative:</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">953 - <i>Nowe of þe kynge of surry . wyll I seye more</i></span><br /><br />

                                <span class="p">1150 - <i>Now tytus counceyle hatħ take . þe town to assayle</i></span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">Although the presence of these initial capitals in C may lend weight to the textual divisions signaled in the other manuscripts, the evidence for relying upon those divisions found in E, V, and D remains murky, as C tends to use large initials at other points where there are no corresponding textual divisions found in the other manuscripts:</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">41 - <i>Now was þer on nathan . naymes sone of greeke</i></span><br /><br />

                                <span class="p">Furthermore, the scribe has a tendency towards making an elaborate, unusually large initial <i>N</i> in other environments on occasion where there is no discernible reason for doing so, e.g. <i>Nowgħt</i> in l.152 and <i>Nor</i> in l. 294. It is clear that these are more elaborate than his usual capital <i>N</i> in, for example <i>Nathan</i> and <i>Not</i> on f. <a class="imglightbox" href="/C112r-lb.html">112r</a>, but unclear why they are so. Because of this uncertainty, none of these points are treated as textual divisions within the transcription, but they are noted here as a puzzling and potentially significant feature of this manuscript.</span><br /><br />

                                <span class="p">The present binding was completed in August 1957 by the British Museum, and measures 222 mm in height, and 210 mm from the center of the spine to the fore edge. Half bound with brown leather spine and corners, brown bookboards. Five raised bands. Headband and tailband in red and yellow thread. A pair of thin, parallel gold-tooled lines run the length of the spine on either side, and similar lines define the top and bottom edge of each compartment on the spine. The bottom compartment, which is larger than the others, is further subdivided by another set of these lines so that there are two areas, one 26mm in height, and the other 11 mm in height. Compartments 1, 5, and 6 decorated with gold-tooled leaf and vine designs around outer edges. Compartments 2, 3, and 4 have gold-tooled text stamped on a green morocco field (other compartments are the same brown leather as rest of binding). </span><br /><br />

In the front, a pastedown and single flyleaf from the twentieth-century binding, plus five additional flyleaves, the innermost of which seem to be fairly early in date and are counted in the foliation. There are only two flyleaves at the back, the outermost of which is part of the modern binding and the innermost apparently from an earlier binding. Between the formerly separate manuscripts, and now numbered as folios 140-143, are what were formerly two paper and two parchment flyleaves, probably belonging originally to Vespasian D. XXI.</span><br /><br />

As a group, the famous Cotton manuscripts were owned by Sir Robert Bruce Cotton (1571-1631) and presented as a gift to the nation of Great Britain by his grandson, Sir John Cotton, in 1700. They were initially housed in Ashburnham House, Westminster, where a fire destroyed or damaged about twenty-five percent of them in 1731.
