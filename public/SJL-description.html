            <div class="origdate"><b>Date: </b>Laud Misc. 656 is likely the
                            oldest of the manuscripts in the <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>
                            corpus, rivaled only by perhaps the Princeton University Library, MS
                            Taylor 11 (P), as Doyle notes when he attributes
                            the poem "to the fourteenth century with confidence, from the
                            earliest-looking copy, in Bodleian Laud misc. 656" (93). Hanna-Lawton
                            concur, dating the manuscript to the end of that century. Guddat-Figge
                            erroneously dates it to the middle of the fifteenth century.</div><div class="support"><b>Support: </b>Parchment</div><div class="extent"><b>Extent: </b>i + 133 folios</div><div class="format"><b>Format: </b>210 x 150
                                        mm</div><div class="foliation"><b>Foliation: </b>Foliation in both ink and pencil, both rather early. The
                                    foliation in ink numbers each leaf 1-5 and thereafter in
                                    intervals of 10 (i.e., 10, 20, 30, etc.). At a later date,
                                    numbers were added in pencil to the unfoliated leaves by a
                                    second hand. In quire X, the second hand corrects an error in
                                    counting by his predecessor, striking through “110” and
                                    replacing it with the correct “111.” Note also that the first
                                    hand returns to number the final leaves of Booklet I
                                    individually, but misnumbers 113, 114, 115, and 116 due the
                                    earlier error at fol. 110. The later foliator strikes through
                                    these and uses 115a and 115b to reach number 116 at the same
                                    point as his predecessor.</div><div class="foliation"><b>Collation: </b> One parchment flyleaf precedes quire I. As Hanna-Lawton
                                    note, the codex contains two booklets, the first comprising ii +
                                    fols. 1-116 and the second comprising fol. 117 to the end. The
                                    following collation refers to the extant modern pencil
                                    foliation.

                                <div class="p">The text is in an anglicana script using brown ink throughout,
                                    and is likely the work of one scribe. Russell-Kane believe the
                                    entire manuscript to be the work of the same scribe, whereas
                                    Hanna-Lawton note that one scribe copied <i>Siege of
                                        Jerusalem</i> with "perhaps a second for the remainder."
                                    There are no running heads in <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>,
                                    but <i>Piers Plowman</i> features running heads starting
                                    on fol. 69 and going through until the end, e.g., “Dowel,”
                                    “Dobet,” and “Dobest.” The first few of these (58v to 63r)
                                    appear to have been added later; the rest are contemporary with
                                    the text. Corrections are sparse, with subpunction on fol.
                                        <a href="images/5r.jpeg">5r</a>, erasures on <a href="images/9r.jpeg">9r</a>, and a few supralinear additions by the main
                                    scribe (e.g., folios <a href="images/3v.jpeg">3v</a>, <a href="images/7v.jpeg">7v</a>, <a href="images/9r.jpeg">9r</a>).</div>

                                    elevatus. Note that the scribe frequently adds a backwards curl

                                    of the other manuscripts are documented in appendices, the
                                    features of L are the focus of his dissertation and are
                                    discussed at great length. He concludes his work with a summary
                                    of the relationships of the dialects found in the manuscript,
                                    noting that L is the westernmost dialect of the group (Kellogg
                                    did not know of P or the Exeter fragment):</div>

                                        East Midland traits. Western features are mainly limited to
                                        one MS: L. It alone shows any retention of OE. ēo as a
                                        rounded vowel. It alone has <i>ȝo</i> for

                                    argument for an authorial dialect from the Barnoldswick-Earby

                                    dialect of the manuscript, although his focus is on the C text
                                    of <i>Piers Plowman</i> rather than <i>SJ</i>.

                                    Oxfordshire scribes,” but it should be noted that in the brief

                                        Plowman</i> may illuminate the debate of whether more
                                    than one scribe worked on this manuscript, although some
                                    differences may of course be attributable to the exemplars. </div>

                                    <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i> has rubricated initials 3-5
                                lines in height at fols. <a href="images/1v.jpeg">1v</a>, <a href="images/7v.jpeg">7v</a>, <a href="images/13v.jpeg">13v</a>, and <a href="images/16r.jpeg">16r</a>; there are no passus divisions marked
                                with paraphs or marginalia, but these multiline capitals correspond
                                to passus divisions recognized by Hanna-Lawton as authorial.
                                    <i>Piers</i> has spaces and guideletters for rubricated
                                initials, e.g., 19v, 25r, but these have not been realized; the same
                                is true in Booklet II, e.g., fol. 119v. </div><div class="handnote"><b>Binding: </b>

                                <div class="p">15th c., English. Binding is 215
                                        mm in height and 170
                                        mm in width as measured from center of spine to
                                    the fore edge. Bound in reddish brown calfskin, rebacked but
                                    otherwise original. Wooden boards, sloped at edges. Four raised
                                    bands as bound, rebacked spine utilizing original bands.
                                    Additionally, two slightly raised sewing structures, one at top
                                    and the other at bottom of spine, detectable. Flat spine.
                                    Turn-ins at front and back are raggedly cut, glued to boards
                                    with no endpaper or other coverings. Grooves with recessed
                                    leather thongs visible in both boards. The binding is not
                                    decorated. Remnants of a strap and clasp, including bits of
                                    metal, present on front cover. The strap apparently hooked to a
                                    metal piece at center of back cover, where there is now a hole
                                    and corresponding discoloration in the leather. Single vellum
                                    flyleaf in front only.</div>
