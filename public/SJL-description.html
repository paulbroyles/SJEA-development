                                    and is likely the work of one scribe. Russell-Kane believe the
                                    entire manuscript to be the work of the same scribe, whereas
                                    Hanna-Lawton note that one scribe copied <i>Siege of
                                        Jerusalem</i> with "perhaps a second for the remainder."
                                    There are no running heads in <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>,
                                    but <i>Piers Plowman</i> features running heads starting

                                    “Dobet,” and “Dobest.” The first few of these (58v to 63r)
                                    appear to have been added later; the rest are contemporary with

                                    the fore edge. Bound in reddish brown calfskin, rebacked but
                                    otherwise original. Wooden boards, sloped at edges. Four raised
                                    bands as bound, rebacked spine utilizing original bands.
                                    Additionally, two slightly raised sewing structures, one at top
                                    and the other at bottom of spine, detectable. Flat spine.
                                    Turn-ins at front and back are raggedly cut, glued to boards
                                    with no endpaper or other coverings. Grooves with recessed

                                    metal, present on front cover. The strap apparently hooked to a
                                    metal piece at center of back cover, where there is now a hole
                                    and corresponding discoloration in the leather. Single vellum
