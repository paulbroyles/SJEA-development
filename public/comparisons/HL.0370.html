This is to account for the missing leaf containg HL lines 293-369. There is, of course, no way to be certain of the exact number of lines that the missing leaf contained, but assuming that the passage in MS A was complete through this portion of the poem with the exception of HL 317-320, lines unique to MS L, 73 lines would be missing. I have therefore chosen to skip this number of lines in my numeration.</td>
