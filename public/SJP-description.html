                                    <span class="p"><i>Siege of Jerusalem</i> is ruled in crayon for two columns of 42 lines each. The writing area varies slightly, approximately 280 x 190 mm; each column 85-88 mm in width. Four vertical lines, one defining each edge of the two columns. Horizontal lines remain within columns except for first two and last two, which extend across the intercolumnar space. Prickings at top and bottom.</span><br /><br />
                                    
                                    <span class="p">Layout is consistent throughout for all three texts, with only minor differences as noted below:</span><br /><br />
                                    
                                    <span class="p"><i>Speculum Vitae</i>: Some variety in size of writing space, but generally 275-280 mm x 195-200mm, with two columns of 42 lines each  measuring 88 mm in width. Same pattern of four vertical lines and horizontal lines contained within columns excepting top and bottom two. Also ruled in crayon. Extensive prickings survive along fore edge, top and bottom. One hole per horizontal line, and one hole each at top and bottom for vertical lines.</span><br /><br />
                                    
                                    <span class="p"><i>Meditaciones passionis Cristi</i>: Same layout as <i>Speculum Vitae</i> and <i>Siege</i>, but features prose in two columns rather than verse. Ruling mostly faded away, and, like <i>Siege</i>, prickings on fore edge tend not to have survived.</span><br /><br />
                                    
                                </div><a name="handnote"></a><div class="handnote"><b>The scribe — script and dialect: </b>
                                <span class="p">One scribe responsible for <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>, using brown ink and an anglicana formata script. A second scribe may be responsible for the other two texts. The text of <i>SJ</i> is not heavily corrected, although there are examples of overwriting, erasure, and deletion, all of which appear to be the work of the original scribe. There are numerous corrections in <i>Speculum Vitae</i>, conversely – e.g., lines added in margin 8v, erasure and corrected text 23v, text added above line with carat 44r. Running heads have been added throughout <i>Speculum</i>, but there are none for <i>SJ</i>.</span><br /><br /> 
                                
                                <span class="p">Punctuation in <i>SJ</i> is sparse. Lines generally begin with capital letter forms; letters that do not have a distinct lower case are likely intended as capitals, but have been transcribed as they appear. The caesura is not usually marked, but in a few instances there is either a medial punctus (e.g., lines 95-97, 101, 103) or punctus elevatus (e.g., lines 148, 258, 259). It is not clear why the scribe uses medial punctuation on the few occasions when he chooses to do so.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">The scribe has a few peculiar or problematic tendencies that are worth noting, some of which create problems of interpretation or consistency in transcriptional policy:</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u><i>-n</i> and <i>-m</i></u>: The scribe frequently places a semicircular tilde (and less frequently a macron) above the combination of vowel plus nasal consonant. While it might be possible to understand this to indicate an expansion doubling the nasal consonant, the fact that he places such a mark above <i>rann</i><span class="graphic">I</span> in l. 12, where the consonant is already doubled, indicates that these marks are likely otiose. In addition, the scribe often adds a large flourish that curves up and back to the left on the letter <i>n</i> when it is the last letter in a word. Good examples of this may be found at the ends of lines 500-503<span class="graphic">I</span> at the bottom left of fol. <a class="imglightbox" href="/P107v-lb.html">107v</a>.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Otiose flourish on <i>-t</i></u>: In a few instances, e.g., lines 666<span class="graphic">I</span> and 766<span class="graphic">I</span>, final <i>-t</i> features an otiose flourish.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Barred letters</u>: The scribe bars <i>-ll</i> almost invariably, even when the letters are followed by a final vowel, and thus there is no evidence that he does so to alter spelling. Barred <i>-h</i> is found on nine occasions, but again this does not bear upon the spelling; for example, the scribe uses the spelling <i>burgħ</i> at lines 592, 599, and 657, but also uses <i>burgh</i> twelve times and <i>burghe</i> once, but does not vary the spelling due to grammatical demands.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u><i>-r'</i></u>: On a few occasions – twice at line 122<span class="graphic">I</span> and once at line 150<span class="graphic">I</span> – the scribe attaches a small flourish to final <i>-r</i>. Although such a flourish is used by some scribes to indicate a suspended <i>-e</i>, there is no evidence to suggest that such was the intention here.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">LALME places the dialect of MS Taylor Medieval 11 near Sedbergh, Westmorland, which, according to Hanna-Lawton, places it closer to the poet's dialect than any other surviving manuscript containing <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>. Although LALME analyzes only folios 14r-15r, 19r-26v, 34r, and 38r-42v, all of which contain portions of <i>Speculum Vitae</i>, an analysis of the forms listed in LALME that are also found in <i>SJ</i> shows that the two works share a dialect.</span><br /><br />

Blue lombards flourished with red mark passus divisions. The first letter of each line is touched in red.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><i>Speculum Vitae</i> features numerous section headings in red, along with extensive marginal annotations and running heads. Numerous 2- to 4-line blue initials with flourishes in red. Flourishing typically in the form of abstract vine and foliage designs, but several also contain a fish –  e.g., 5r, 84v. In addition to marginal commentary in red, there are numerous red paraphs – see, e.g., the opening 34v-35r where nearly every line is preceded by such a mark. The first letter of each line touched in red.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">In <i>Meditaciones passionis Christi</i>, incipit rubricated along with section headings and numerous paraph marks. Blue initials with red flourishes, as found in <i>Speculum Vitae</i>. The first letter of any given line not touched in red as with other texts, presumably because this is a prose translation. A number of decorative ascenders in main scribal hand extend into top margins – e.g., 100v, 101r.

Five raised bands on spine.  Headband and tailband of green thread. Front and back covers decorated identically, all decorations blind tooled. An outer frame is formed by a tripartite border consisting of one broad line in the center of two thin lines. This frame measures 355 x 255 mm. A second frame, set in 20 mm from the first, is made from the same tool and overlaps at the outer corners so that both the horizontal and vertical lines extend out to meet those forming the outer frame. In the square spaces formed at each corner by these intersecting lines is a design from a single tool featuring a flower surrounded by several lines –  square on four sides but curving in at the corners, and a fleur de lis at each corner. Rawhide ties on front and back. In both front and back, a pastedown formed from white parchment and a single parchment flyleaf.</span><br /><br />

                            <span class="p">The early history of the manuscript has been the subject of some debate and speculation. N. R. Ker's <i>Medieval Libraries of Great Britain</i>, 2nd ed., (London, 1964), lists the manuscript as having belonged to the "Aug. priory of B. V. M. in Bolton, Yorkshire, on the basis of Ker's reading of an <i>ex libris</i> as <i>Liber beate Marie de Bolton in Crauen</i>. Doyle, however, disagrees with this (see "The Manuscripts," note 18), stating he and Ker "agree that another name than the last occurs in the defective ex-libris on fol. 1, which looks to me like 'Liber beate Marie de Bolton in Tower.'" This led Doyle to argue that the manuscript probably belonged to "a church or convent, probably in the West Riding of Yorkshire" (93). The <i>ex libris</i> has become considerably less legible since Ker and Doyle read it. It is not known who owned the manuscript prior to the twentieth century, but it eventually came into the possession of Captain Robert Petre and was sold at auction by Sotheby's in 1952. It was purchased by Quaritch booksellers for £350, and in turn listed in Quaritch catalogue 716 (1953, item 319). Quaritch sold it to Laurence Witten, and it was subsequently sold to Robert Taylor, who bequeathed it to Princeton University Library. </span><br /><br />
                            
                            <span class="p">A couple of inscriptions within the book might provide further clues to ownership. On the recto of the front flyleaf is written in pencil <i>If it belonged to the Judge Walmesley?</i>.
