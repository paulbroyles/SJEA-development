    <p>Like all projects of this scope, <em>The Siege of Jerusalem Electronic Archive</em> has been a
       collaborative venture spanning a number of years. My first debt is to the libraries and
       librarians who have preserved these manuscripts, made them available for consultation,
       and provided images and permission to use them in this archive. The staffs of the Bodleian
       Library, the British Library, Cambridge University Library, the Devon Record Office, the
       Huntington Library, Lambeth Palace Library, and Princeton University Library have been
       unfailingly helpful and professional. Among these, a number of individuals deserve special
       mention. Bruce Barker Benfield of the Bodleian Library was very helpful in acquiring rights
       to MS Laud Misc. 656 and in advising me on my trips to the library to consult the book
       in person. Claire Breay, Head of Medieval and Earlier Manuscripts at the British Library,
       has been very generous with her time and offered valuable assistance in acquiring rights
       to publish the images of MS Additional 31042, MS Cotton Caligula A.ii, and MS Cotton
       Vespasian E. xvi. David Garner provided the images of Devon Record Office, Deposit 2507,
       and the staff of the Record Office were very accommodating in providing him with access to
       the Exeter fragment. Mary Robertson’s professionalism and knowledge of the Huntington
       and its collections made my visits to the library and the process of acquiring rights to HM
       128 a pleasure. Don Skemer, Curator of Manuscripts at Princeton University Library, went
       above and beyond in helping me to acquire images of MS Taylor Medieval 11 by assisting
       me with enhanced images of damaged portions of the book and checking inscriptions
       under UV light.

    <p>The project has benefitted from the financial support of a number of institutions. A Digital
       Humanities Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities’ Office of Digital
       Humanities supported a year of leave time, travel funds, and the acquisition of digital
       images of all manuscripts. The Department of English and the CHASS Office of Research and
       Engagement at North Carolina State University provided funding for web development. A
       travel grant from the Bibliographical Society of America and funding from the University of
       Virginia’s Department of English allowed me to travel to consult the manuscripts in person
       while working on a previous version of this project for my dissertation; my early research
       was also supported by a UVA Faculty Senate Fellowship.

    </br>

    <p>I have recently benefitted from much support and encouragement from my colleagues at
       North Carolina State University. Tony Harrison, Head of the Department of English, Jeff
       Braden, Dean of the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, and Tom Birkland,
       head of the CHASS Office of Research and Engagement, have been very supportive of this
       and other research initiatives. The staff of the CHASS Office of Research and Engagement,
       including Missy Seate, Paula Braswell, and Joyce Jones Christian, have offered invaluable
       assistance on a regular basis. Kristin Antelman, Tim Mori, and Maurice York of NCSU
       Libraries have leant their expertise and made sure that the archive has a home on NCSU
       servers.

    <p>Laura Mandell and Matt Christy of the Initiative for Digital Humanities, Media, and Culture
       at Texas A&M University have been more than generous in dedicating time and expertise
       to the project, providing invaluable help by writing XSL transformations for the manuscript
       transcriptions and descriptions. The team at Performant Software, including Nick
       Laiacona, Dave Goldstein, and Kristin Jensen, are to be applauded for their professional
       and enthusiastic approach to developing the site. John Ivor Carlson was very helpful in
       transforming early versions of the transcriptions to their current state, and adding word-
       level tagging and verse divisions to them.
    </p>

    </br>

    <p>All of the above would not have happened without Hoyt N. Duggan, who has been a
       nonpareil friend, mentor, and advocate. He first called my attention to the poem, hired
       me as a graduate assistant for the <em>Piers Plowman Electronic Archive</em>, where I learned the
       ropes for building digital editions of medieval manuscripts, and has helped with everything
       from letters of support to dialect analysis and transcription protocols since then. He also
       served as advisor for my dissertation, which was a CD-ROM version of this archive modeled
       on PPEA publications. I was very fortunate that my dissertation committee also included
       David Vander Meulen, who taught me most of what I know about editing, and Jerome
       McGann, whose wealth of knowledge and passion for all things textual, digital, and editorial
       inspires much of the work I do today.
    </p>

    </br>

    <p>The University of Virginia provided a number of other important colleagues and mentors
       as well. Patricia Bart generously lent her mastery of many skills, from Latin to Photoshop
       to text encoding. Terry Belanger, founder and former Director of Rare Book School, took
       me under his wing and introduced me to many inspiring people and ideas in the world of
       old books. The courses that I took at RBS from Albert Derolez, Jan Storm van Leeuwen, Paul
       Needham, and Will Noel equipped me to do much of the work required in an undertaking
       such as this one.
    </p>

    </br>

    <p>The two years I spent at Johns Hopkins University also contributed much to my work on
       this project. Sayeed Choudhury and Stephen Nichols, directors of the <em>Roman de la Rose</em>
       Digital Library, a project on which I worked as a postdoctoral fellow, supported my time
       spent away at Rare Book School and allowed me the opportunity to learn much about
       medieval books and representing those books in an online environment. Both encouraged
       and supported me by writing letters on my behalf and offering me many opportunities for
       professional development.
    </p>

    </br>

    <p>Finally, my wife Jennifer has been my partner and unwavering supporter through every
       step mentioned above, from Charlottesville to Baltimore to Raleigh. I owe her enormous
       gratitude for her untiring encouragement, which never lessened despite many weeks of
       travel away from home and countess hours – including many nights and weekends – that
       I’ve spent at the computer and in library reading rooms.
