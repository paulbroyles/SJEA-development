Foliation is continuous across these three units, however, commencing on the first parchment leaf and continuing throughout. Fol. 5 is repeated with an asterisk beside the second 5, which occurs on a blank leaf. Pairs of blank parchment leaves following fols. 25, 37, and 69 are not numbered; these were added by the binder. Fols. 1-5 in modern hand in pencil, and an earlier foliation which began on what is now 2r has been lined through; the doubling of fol. 5 permits the usage of an earlier foliation in ink, which runs throughout consecutively but appears to be in several hands. Fols. 62-77 were once numbered 70-85, while fols. 78-85 were once numbered 62-69, with the older numbers now crossed through, which suggests that the final two quires were previously bound in reverse order. The evidence of the quire signatures and the missing lines of <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>, however, suggest that quire VI would not have come before quire V when the manuscript was first produced; apparently the quires were previously bound out of order, a mistake corrected in a later rebinding.</div><a name="collation"></a><div class="collation"><b>Collation: </b>

                                    Each quire is sewn through the center to a stub in the modern binding. Quire marks suggest that there were formerly two quires between what are now the fourth and fifth quires. These must have contained the beginning of <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>; at about 30 lines per leaf, there would be 480 lines per quire, thus 960 in the two quires, which, with the 362 extant lines, would amount to a full copy of the poem. Quires are numbered <i>x-xiii</i> on leaves 38r, 46r, 54r, and 62r, and 70r is numbered <i>xvi</i>. 45v (i.e., the end of quire I) is labeled <i>a</i>, with 46r, 54r, and 62r labeled <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>. A single catchword survives at 53v.

                                <span class="p">Previous scholars have disagreed on the number of scribes and the distribution of their work. Guddat-Figge lists four scribes, with the first copying fols. 38r-69v, the second fols. 70r-75v, the third fols. 76r-82v, and the fourth fols. 83r-85r (179). Hanna-Lawton agree that there were four scribes, but suggest that each section is by “a different hand and the two items of the second booklet different hands” (xvii). The manuscript was also consulted by the editors of LALME (LP 553), who state that there is only one hand throughout (422).</span><br /><br /> 
                                
                                <span class="p">I argue conversely that there are two scribes. Scribe 1 copied fols. 38-69 using dark ink and an anglicana script mixed with secretary forms. Scribe 2 copied fols. 70-85 in brown ink and a secretary hand. A side-by-side analysis of English words occurring in <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i> as well as in item 5, the prose treatise on physiognomy, is useful for confirming that the same hand is responsible for both. For example, <i>And</i> on <a class="imglightbox" href="/V070r-lb.html">70r</a> and 83r<span id="And-popup" class="popup-span"><div id="And" class="popup-image"></div></span><span src="And" class="graphic">I</span>, <i>moche</i> on <a class="imglightbox" href="/V072v-lb.html">72v</a> and 83r<span id="moche-popup" class="popup-span"><div id="moche" class="popup-image"></div></span><span src="moche" class="graphic">I</span>, <i>þ[er]fore</i> on <a class="imglightbox" href="/V072r-lb.html">72r</a> and 83r<span id="Therfore-popup" class="popup-span"><div id="Therfore" class="popup-image"></div></span><span src="Therfore" class="graphic">I</span>, and <i>wołł</i> on <a class="imglightbox" href="/V075r-lb.html">75r</a> and 83r. While a word-to-word comparison cannot be made between <i>SJ</i> and the Latin texts in fols. 76r-82v, a comparison of letterforms indicates that these texts are by the same scribe who copied the English texts that bookend them. For example, the roman numeral <i>xxx</i> on <a class="imglightbox" href="/V075r-lb.html">75r</a> and 82v<span id="xxxti-popup" class="popup-span"><div id="xxxti" class="popup-image"></div></span><span src="xxxti" class="graphic">I</span>, the distinctive capital <i>T</i><span id="CapitalT-popup" class="popup-span"><div id="CapitalT" class="popup-image"></div></span><span src="CapitalT" class="graphic">I</span> and capital <i>D</i><span id="CapitalD-popup" class="popup-span"><div id="CapitalD" class="popup-image"></div></span><span src="CapitalD" class="graphic">I</span> found throughout, as well as the distinctive flat-topped capital <i>N</i><span id="CapitalN-popup" class="popup-span"><div id="CapitalN" class="popup-image"></div></span><span src="CapitalN" class="graphic">I</span>.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">As Hanna-Lawton note, the fact that the scribe responsible for <i>The Three Kings of Cologne</i> is not the same as the scribe who copied <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i> means that we cannot apply the conclusions that the editors of LALME draw to <i>SJ</i>. While noting that the scribe of <i>Siege</i> does share agreement with LALME LP 553 in some instances, they also list a number of dialect features that point not to Oakham, Rutland, as LALME posits, but further east near Lincoln. They raise the possibility that “LALME’s LP 553 may show some interference from the <i>Three Kings</i> exemplar” (xvii). Kellogg's analysis of the manuscript's language, which focused exclusively on the <i>SJ</i> portion of the text, also attributes the scribe to the east Midlands, although he does not offer a more specifc locality. He does, however, provide a list of thirty dialect features, some of which, such as the <i>-and</i> present participle termination mentioned by Hanna-Lawton, make it clear that the dialect is distinct from that of <i>Three Kings of Cologne</i>. Hanna-Lawton also note the presence of the register of charters pertaining to Lincoln Cathedral in the front of the book; while this is not codicologically related to the portion containing <i>Three Kings</i> or <i>Siege</i>, it might be a further sign “pointing to such an east Midland provenance” (xvii).</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p">Scribe 2 uses a variety of typical suspensions and abbreviations. The text is not heavily corrected, although there are examples of overwriting, erasure, and deletion, all of which appear to be the work of the original scribe and are handled according to the policy discussed in the general introduction. In addition, he has a number of peculiar or problematic tendencies that are worth noting, some of which create problems of interpretation or consistency in transcriptional policy:</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Curl on <i>-r</i></u>: In nine instances, the scribe places a curl on final <i>-r</i>. In most cases, it is apparent that this is intended to be expanded to <i>-re</i>, as in <i>her[e]</i>, l. 43<span id="V43rcurl-popup" class="popup-span"><div id="V43rcurl" class="popup-image"></div></span><span src="V43rcurl" class="graphic">I</span>, which is elsewhere spelled <i>here</i>, and <i>tresour[e]</i>, l. 51, which is elsewhere spelled <i>tresoure</i>. In three cases – <i>brothir</i>, l. 29, and <i>copper</i> and <i>silvir</i>, both at l. 300 – the curl seems merely to be a flourish, as it does not curve back as far as the other six examples and the spelling does not require an expansion to <i>-re</i>. Thus these three have been transcribed <i>-r'</i>.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Barred letters</u>: Barred letters, which tend to be otiose throughout most of the <i>SJ</i> corpus, are used by this scribe to indicate suspended <i>-e</i>, and have been expanded in the text accordingly. Note, e.g., barred <i>wałł</i> 1x vs. <i>walle</i> elsewhere, and <i>tille</i> vs. barred <i>tiłł</i>. Note also <i>higħ</i> vs. <i>highe</i>.</span><br /><br />
                                
                                <span class="p"><u>Otiose tildes</u>: The scribe frequently uses an otiose tilde, as at <i>worship</i>, l. 19<span id="V19tilde-popup" class="popup-span"><div id="V19tilde" class="popup-image"></div></span><span src="V19tilde" class="graphic">I</span>, <i>come</i>, l. 75, and <i>wrought</i>, l. 154. He is especially prone to place this mark above the letter <i>p</i>, as he does with <i>worship</i> at l. 19, <i>vp</i>, l. 30, and <i>hap</i>, l. 42.</span><br /><br />

An <i>ex libris</i> in the group of leaves comprising fols. 2-11, material unrelated to the manuscript containing <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>, reads <i>liber cartarum eccleise beate Marie Lincoliensis</i>. As discussed above, it is impossible to know whether this has bearing on the origins of the portion of the book containing <i>SJ</i>. As a group, the famous Cotton manuscripts were owned by Sir Robert Bruce Cotton (1571-1631) and presented as a gift to the nation of Great Britain by his grandson, Sir John Cotton, in 1700. They were initially housed in Ashburnham House, Westminster, where a fire destroyed or damaged about twenty-five percent of them in 1731.
